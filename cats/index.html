Writer&#39;s log:
Began this today in a moment of seratonin spurt. I don&#39;t know if it will continue, but I&#39;d love to write 300 words a day and end up with something like a novel in a year&#39;s time. I&#39;m about to start my new job at Bournemouth. I am healthy, despite the raging pandemic, and fairly secure in home, family, and farm critters. I&#39;m watching a lot of Lucifer, Dark, Lovecraft Country, Roswell New Mexico, Wynonna Earp. Listening to Roswell playlist today. Also writing my academic book on arts-science interdisciplinarity.

Heleth needed to pee. Quite badly, really. She very much regretted the entire pot of coffee she&#39;d downed.

She considered her dilemma: risk bladder rupture – or at least an irritating UTI – or disrupt the cat.

The cat, of course, wouldn&#39;t care one way or the other. Should Heleth choose to unmoor herself from the sofa and lumber to the toilet, Lovelace would simply shift her napping spot to the warmth left from Heleth&#39;s ever-spreading backend, barely registering the human&#39;s absence at all. No, it was Heleth who didn&#39;t want to risk losing the snuggly comfort embodied by the small creature. It provided her only source of oxytocin let-down.

In time-honored tradition, Heleth distracted herself from the pressing need of her bodily functions by finger-marching her way across the internet. Twitter was on fire today with a distinct uptick in fannish obsession with Tom Holland. Instagram was incensed over the possibility that a Jenner and/or Kardashian might or might not have written a caption with an ambiguous statement about their ethnic background or lack thereof. Facebook was full of her friends and family that she&#39;d unfollowed (but not unfriended) because they were problematic. Or just whiny.

Facebook Marketplace, however, was a bastion of joy as usual. Between her unrelenting misanthropy, burgeoning agoraphobia, cultured introversion, and the current raging pandemic, Heleth could not possibly venture into the real world to purchase the bizarre, mundane, idiosyncratic items posted on the local exchange. She loved, however, entering strangers&#39; homes and lives through their items, the horrendous photos, the backgrounds of closets and gardens and coffee tables, and the cryptic descriptions. She saved dozens of images and screenshots to her hard drive: a pocket calculator here, a broken tractor there, a macramé tribute to Grand Theft Auto there.

Lovelace yawned and stretched, her paws kneading into Heleth&#39;s abdomen JUST. THERE.

Writer&#39;s log:
Day 2! I feel quite good about this, and am enjoying it so far (ask me again on day 350). Had a hapless day of letting the dog out, nearly missing meetings, falling in the mud, getting soaked in the rain, but I&#39;m dry and warm now, with a tupperware full of blackberries for a crumble. So life could be worse. W: Wynonna Earp, Lovecraft Country. L: 90s/2000s mixes R: 10K Doors of January,  Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day (both quite good!).
[continue]
It was just enough to push Heleth over the edge, physiologically speaking. She would start leaking at any moment.

She sighed and picked the little tortie up, risking the loss of an eye Nick Fury style to snuggle her nose into Lovelace’s soft belly. “Who’s the bestest kitteh in the whole wide world?”

Lovelace didn’t know, and furthermore, didn’t care. She did that thing cats do where they are heavier than a planet yet obey no laws of gravity, and turned herself inside out. Heleth lost her grip, and the feline acrobat flipped onto her laptop.

Laptop, laptop desk, coffee, even lap blanket crashed into the coffee table in a heap. Heleth uttered a gargled scream as she watched the rich warm liquid of life seep through the chinks in her keyboard’s armor, leaving only death in its wake. The cat’s screech harmonized with her own as coffee bean soup invited her toebeans to become one with it, her deathblades striking another blow to the laptop. Heleth reached out her arms in a mawkish hug, attempting to wrap everything – coffee, cat, couch, comforter – in a safe embrace.

She failed.

Instead of setting the ship to rights, Heleth’s attempt merely cast her overboard along with everything else. Leaning forward, her Monty Python death bunny slipper caught a corner of her triple-wolf throw, twisting her center of balance *just-so*. She went down on the top of the heap, bouncing her noggin off the coffee table on her way.

“Unh,” Heleth said, her eyes closed.

After a very long moment in which she was certain the room turned widdershins at least three times, she blinked and looked around.

The coffee in the laptop must have blown a fuse. Darkness reigned, save a skylight directly above her. Only Heleth had no skylight; directly above her flat was Mr. Abawe’s flat, and the Akhils above that. 

“Lovelace?” she whispered.

“The fuck just happened?” Lovelace replied.

I&#39;ve been writing research-based works and academic books and papers for so many months now I&#39;m not sure if I can still write for myself! So I decided to try an experiment: write 300 words a day for a year, on one story, in order and continuously, and see if there&#39;s a novel in it at the end.

I start with nothing but the title: *The Unbearable Heaviness of Cats*. This is a place-holder story I&#39;ve used for years in my teaching when I needed to create a sample for students (e.g., Twine game, manuscript formatting guide, etc.). Many students actually think the text is real. So I thought, why not make it so?

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE STORY WILL BE. I sit down fresh every day. So your guess is as good as mine.

Well, as usual, I spent a good deal of time on this today getting distracted by code, trying to make it so that I don&#39;t have to update the links manually every day. I was not successful - I&#39;m finding Chapbook limited so far. Or maybe that&#39;s just my really poor grasp of Javascript. Bah.

Anyway, I made it a little prettier, and gave it a dark mode option, so there&#39;s that.

Stormy weather here today, and Paul was in town, so my company has been very snuggly kitties for most of the day. Which I love, but also I miss Paul. Kinda hope he never really goes back to work 9-5 on campus.

R: Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day (finished), 10k doors of January
L: 90s/2000s mix (still too much Bowling for Soup, I think)
W: not much. half the first ep of &quot;Teenage Bounty Hunters&quot;

Post-passage note: 
I wrote this after spending a little time on Twitter, where I sent this tweet: https://twitter.com/lskains/status/1299360727942258690. The verse wound up in this passage! Life overlaps writing. Obvs.
[continue]
Heleth blinked. *Hard*.

“Lovey, was… was that *you*?”

“I don’t see anyone else here.”

Heleth scrambled to sitting, which given her position and her general lack of physical acuity, took several moments. Once she managed it, she found Lovelace sitting contentedly on a coal black floor, idly cleaning a paw. The blue beam from the skylight spot-lit her as though she were a French starlet.

Which distracted Heleth enough to look up. The skylight was not a skylight, but Heleth wasn’t quite sure just what it was. The blue tinge hinted that it was a screen of some sort, but she couldn’t make out an image.

She peered closely, squinting at a corner of the glowing rectangle.

“Oh!” She leaned forward. “That’s my coffee mug!”

Indeed, the black and white cartoon cat on the mug was just visible, cavorting around a flirty few lines of verse:

*Love to eat them meeces \
Meeces what I love to eat \
Bite they tiny heads off \
Nibble on they tiny feet*

“Infantilizing mockery,” Lovelace commented. “I’ve been trying to knock that thing into pieces for three years.”

Heleth couldn’t be sure she was actually hearing the voice, or that the voice actually belonged to her beloved feline. The tortie’s mouth didn’t move, thank goodness; Heleth considered animated talking animals an ultimate trough of the Uncanny Valley. But the voice was correct: there was no one else here. And it certainly *sounded* like something Lovelace would say.

“Lovelace?” Heleth whispered again.

“Is the name you call me, and I suppose it could be worse.”

“What the hell is happening?”

Lovelace yawned, and turned her attention to the swirl of fur on her chest. “Based on experience, we appear to be on the other side of a door.”

“What door?”

“Honestly, how humans consider themselves an intelligent species really is beyond me.” Heleth couldn’t see the cat rolling her eyes, but she sure could hear it.

Bit of a hard day today. Woke at 3am with Meegan screaming because she&#39;d lost her grip on the tiles, fallen, and couldn&#39;t get up. We knew it was time, and laid her to rest today. She&#39;s got a pear tree, and Paul will put Fergus with her soon. So I&#39;ve just watched terrible movies all day, and managed to get this done.
[continue]
Heleth squeezed her eyes shut and willed her lounge back around her. Open.

“Dammit.” She stood, shuffling closer to the blue rectangle. Accepting, somehow, that her grumpy little feline was speaking to her, telepathically, no less, Heleth reached out to touch the screen.

“I wouldn’t.”

“Why?”

“You already don’t know how you got *here*. Are you going to be so asinine as to keep touching things when you don’t know what they do?” Lovelace’s eyes were at half-lid, which could either mean she was rather pleased with herself, or waiting for her prey to fall into a trap. It could go either way.

“Have you been here before? Where’s the door?”

Lovelace tilted her head in a gesture Heleth could only assume was a shrug. “Wheres and whens are all relative, you know. At the very least, if I’ve been to this particular *space* before, I haven’t been here in this *time*, and certainly not with you. Probably.”

Heleth pressed a thumb against her right eye, calming the twitch. One thing at a time. “Okay. I hit my head. I’m clearly concussed. I can see my coffee mug, and… is that a bunny slipper?” She looked down. Her left foot was still embedded in its fanged bunny, but her right had only a slouched wool sock. She reached up one hand to a corner of the display. “I think I can see – it *is*. It’s an icon. This is my laptop screen! We’re in the laptop!”

Her hands clapped out an excited twitter. Lovelace made no acknowledgement.

“Shit.” Heleth’s hands fell to her sides. “We’re in the laptop?!”

She swooped down and plucked up Lovelace, who uttered a plaintive squawk. “I could kill you and eat for weeks,” she told Heleth.

“Shut up, you. Look. You see in the dark better than I do. Where’s the *door*?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Notes" tags="" position="0,125" size="100,100">28 Aug 2020
First, while Chapbook is pretty, the lack of macros compared to Sugarcube 2 is making me insane. I can&#39;t do basic stuff I&#39;m used to doing. Argh. I do. not. get. it.

I&#39;m going to name some passages to make the notes easier (given the sequential numbers):
--YESTERDAY: the content passage frome the previous day (aka, the last 300 words of the story)
--TODAY: the content passage for today. It will START the day with the &quot;you have caught up message&quot;, and end the day with the last 300 words of the story.
--TOMORROW: the &quot;you&#39;ve caught up&quot; passage, which will become the content passage tomorrow.

Daily tasks:
1. Create a new TOMORROW passage.
2. Copy/paste all contents from TODAY to TOMORROW.
3. Update TOMORROW&#39;s previous link.
4. Cut/paste the following from YESTERDAY&#39;s VARS section to TODAY&#39;s VARS section:
config.header.left: story.name
config.style.page.header.font: &quot;16/italic&quot;
config.style.page.header.color: &quot;gray-6&quot;
config.style.page.footer.color: &quot;gray-6&quot;

Still a bit of a down day, but doing okay. Binged S01 of Teenage Bounty Hunters, watched an ep of Wynonna Earp, some Extreme Cakemakers. Reading Riot Baby.
[continue]
“Doors aren’t necessarily something you can see,” Lovelace said. “It’s just sort of a feeling.”

“Well, can you *feel* a door here?”

“Nope.”

Heleth tucked Lovelace under her arm and turned around a few times. The cat went limp, dangling in resignation.

“Nothing?” Heleth asked, her voice rising. “Not even in that direction?”

“I’m not a Geiger counter, Heleth.”

“How do you know what a Geiger counter is? You’re a cat.”

“You’re a human.” It was a statement of fact, so how did it make Heleth feel grimy?

“Fine,” Heleth grumped. “We’re going this way.”

Lovelace in tow, she marched off into the darkness. She expected to encounter a wall, something she could reach out, touch, follow to a corner, a door, a hallway, a window, a freaking porthole. But nothing. After a few dozen steps even the light from the backside of her laptop screen was gone, and she was plunged into a dark as thick as molasses.

No sights, no sounds, no breezes, and yet Heleth felt it all swirl around her.

“Lovey, can you see anything?”

“Not me. But keep going. We’ll get there eventually.”

“Get *where*? Are you incapable of speaking in a straightforward manner?”

“What’s the fun in that?”

Even so, she wasn’t wrong. At first, Heleth thought she was imagining it. A dot of blue light in the distance – maybe it was just her concussion, but she aimed for it, and it eventually got brighter and bigger. She could only hope that it was some way out, rather than just a circle back to her own laptop, which was highly feasible given her lopsided footwear.

As they neared, she breathed a sigh of relief. Even before she could see what was on the screen, she knew it wasn’t hers. It was moving, animated, text populating at the bottom and scrolling upward.

“Oh. Hells. Yes.” Heleth squeezed the dignity out of Lovelace. “It’s a D&amp;D game!”

Slow day today. Bank hol Monday, but I have PMS migraine and fatigue. Got it done though. Spent the day watching White Collar for the eye candy. Read a little of Riot Baby.
[continue]
“If you strap that wizard hat to my head again, I’m going to eat your spleen,” Lovelace commented. She had been present at a grand total of one D&amp;D game that Heleth had hosted – warm bodies inattentive to their pizza had seemed a win-win at the time – and suffered both this indignity as well as being named the party’s “emotive healer”. It wasn’t *her* fault her purr motor was pure reflex based on strokes per minute.

Heleth scritched her head, setting said traitor motor running. “Never fear, deary. It’s trapped back at the house.”

The virtual quest was difficult for Heleth to read, given she was looking at it from behind the screen. After a few moments, however, she sucked in her breath.

“This is… I don’t understand.” Her arms went slack, and Lovelace thumped unceremoniously to the ground. “This is my party.”

“I don’t care if it is. Crying is not allowed.” It had taken Lovelace three hours last time to clean her fur of the snot and salty tears.

The wobbly human ignored her. “They’re playing without me. Why would they do that?”

“Perhaps you died.”

“I didn’t! Eliaurat has never been slain in battle. Look, this is a different campaign. They just – they’re campaigning without me.”

Lovelace sat, neatly wrapping her tail around herself. “I meant, perhaps *you* died. There was quite a satisfying thunk when you toppled.”

“That *just* happened. I can see the date and time. It’s not like we’ve been in some magical ghostland where time goes weird. They’ve been playing without me. On purpose.”

Heleth slumped to the floor, joining Lovelace only without any of the elegance. Detecting the beginnings of a sob, Lovelace edged away.

“Am I a horrible person?” Heleth wept.

“Depends on what your definition of a person is. From my perspective, you would definitely starve to death without the Tesco van. You also have terrible taste in rodents.”

“I don’t eat rodents.”

“Exactly.”

First day at Bournemouth. No info yet, so I&#39;m just carrying on with life. Got this done a bit early today (it&#39;s only a little after 3pm, unlike midnight, which is when I usually do it!). W: White Collar R: After the Flood, Riot Baby
[continue]
Heleth pulled her knees up and cried into them. In a moment of mammalian camaraderie, Lovelace offered her a headbutt.

“We should keep walking,” Lovelace said.

“Why, so I can find other people who hate me?”

Lovelace patted her awkwardly, then resorted to mewing. She padded off a little ways, and mewed again.

Heleth took a breath and lay her head sideways on her knees, staring blearily at the cat.

“Mew,” Lovelace said again.

“Are you manipulating me?”

“Meeeeeew,” replied Lovelace. She rubbed herself across Heleth’s shins and tried the follow-my-lead prance again.

“Two seconds ago you said I was a bad person,” Heleth complained.

“*MEEEEWWWW*,” Lovelace said plaintively. She now combined a headbutt with a shin rub.

“Oh, fine, all right!” Heleth rolled to her knees and then clambered to her feet, and the tortie trilled triumphantly and trotted away.

The darkness lasted longer this time, and Heleth wondered bleakly – dramatically, perhaps – if that was because it was coming from inside her. The only thing keeping her shuffling along was the occasional chirp from Lovelace out in front of her, urging her forward.

A new blue glow eventually emerged, and Heleth approached it reluctantly, lest it reach out and zap her as the last one had.

Lovelace stretched up her leg, claws poking her skin delicately, and Heleth obeyed the request for a lift and cuddle. “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing,” she whispered to the tortie, who simply purred and pushed her nose into the crook of Heleth’s elbow.

The new screen turned out to be much friendlier than the last. She should follow Lovelace’s lead more often, she thought. She was three paragraphs in, enjoying a rather nuanced ST:TNG fan fiction, when she gasped.

“I remember this! This one’s mine!”

With her free arm, she reached out instinctively to the screen, hoping to scroll down for more. It sucked her right in like a vacuum hose swallowing a sock. It even made that horrid gurgling sound.

Bit of an HR snafu at Bournemouth, so my start date has been pushed back till the 9th. Ouch on the loss of income, but hopefully it will all be straightened out soon. Otherwise, a wholly unproductive day spent with horrible cramps hiding inside from horrible weather. W: Wynonna Earp, White Collar R: Riot Baby

Regarding the text so far, I was on the struggle bus the last two days. Introducing the D&amp;D game wasn&#39;t great, because I don&#39;t know much about that, so that&#39;s why I blagged that they&#39;d left her out. Now I kind of want to take her around the internet on the one hand as a love letter to the internet, but also eventually to get into some of its darker stuff (filter bubbles, racism, alt-right, etc.). 
[continue]
“Spot has always utilized his designated waste area appropriately,” Lieutenant Data commented. “I am uncertain why anyone would be concerned about feline cross contamination.”

Heleth froze, Lovelace in her arms. She was standing, hopefully unobtrusively, next to the replicator in the canteen on the USS *Enterprise* NCC 1701-D, circa 2369 (or 1993 in non-TV years). Data, the much beloved android, and Geordi La Forge, classic visor and all, sat nearby at a table, the remains of a meal littered before them. Various crewmembers – no-name extras, probably – filtered around, creating a cafeteria din.

“Data,” Geordi was replying, “I’m not saying Spot isn’t incredibly clean, but this is a limited environment!”

“It is a highly regulated environment, Geordi,” Data said reasonably, as always, “which nonetheless participates in a sustainable ecological cycle, albeit artificial. There is plenty of scope to accommodate one small orange cat.”

Heleth didn’t quite remember such a detailed conversation regarding Spot’s ecological (and fecalogical) functions in her old fanfic. She eyed the canteen – there they were. The focus of the story had been the dramatic sexual tension between Worf and Riker, even as the heteronormative writers smashed Riker and Troi together like hapless Ken and Barbie dolls. Data and Geordi were scenescaping in this particular story.

“Would you agree, Ensign LeMar?”

Startled by the sound of her name – from Data’s monochromatic lips, no less – Heleth turned her attention back to the two officers in front of her.

“Sorry – what?”

Data inclined his head toward Lovelace, still curled neatly at Heleth’s bosom. “As a fellow cat companion, I presumed that you would agree that the mental health benefits of our pets by far outweigh the cost of integrating their life cycles into the delicate ecosystem of a starship.”

Geordi waved a hand and shook his head at Data. “And I think it’s a luxury that has a higher cost than you think. I bet Ensign LeMar had to give up some privileges to get permission to bring her cat on board.”

Not much happening today. Just working and, you know. Being here.
R: haven&#39;t started a new one yet. W: White Collar, Eurovision (movie). L: some playlists on Amazon. Nothing in particular.
[continue]
Before Heleth could answer, Lovelace leapt from her arms onto the replicator, where a crew member had just requested a Palamarian sea urchin. Apparently the scent of it was too much to resist; Lovelace snatched from the receiving tray and gleefully darted for the door to the corridor.

“Lovelace!” Heleth shouted, running after her.

“Good name,” Data commented as she dashed past.

The little thief evaded Heleth, and every other bemused crew member they crashed into, until, finally, like an archangel descending from the golden streets of heavenly urbanity, *he* appeared.

Heleth wasn’t even sure she 100% swung his direction – she chalked her sexual awakening to *both* him and Deanna Troi in equal measure. But she was also convinced that Will Riker – not so much Jonathan Frakes, but specifically *Will Riker* – was whatever the reciprocal version of a pansexual was. Special pheromones or something wafted from him that attracted any and all sexes, species, and orientations. And of course, he was more than happy to oblige their temptations.

Lovelace was not immune. She mewed from behind her mouthful of sea urchin, dropped it at his feet, and wound herself around his ankles in a figure eight.

He folded up his long, long frame and picked the kitty up. She immediately melted into a kitty-gasm, flopping languidly in his arms, her purr motor revved to hot-rod-no-muffler volume.

Stroking her, he quirked that one eyebrow at Heleth, and she discreetly placed a palm on the bulkhead to steady herself. She prayed to the spirit of Uhura that the warmth down there was not evident on her clothing; thank *fuck* that beaming into this site had costumed her in a full ensign’s uniform/onesie, black pants and all.

“She’s beautiful,” Riker commented, his voice funneling over her skin like caramel. “Is she yours?”

Heleth humina-humina-huminaed for several interminable moments. During that eternity, she was thirteen again, too tall, too confused, too certain that she was substandard and wrong as a human being.

Well, I finally got through White Collar today, which threatened to destroy me. I have NO IDEA why I got so emotionally wrapped up in what was pretty much an ordinary network TV show. Neal faked his death in the last ep, only we didn&#39;t know that, and I was sobbing my pathetic heart out till the end. Well played, a-hole writers. Well played.

Otherwise, business as usual. Trying to get Paypal sorted for Wonderbox to go live. Killing me.

R: nothing new today. W: finish White Collar. L: nothing today.
[continue]
If Riker noticed her discomfort, he had the class not to point it out. He simply continued sending Lovelace to kitty nirvana until Heleth finally stammered, “M-m-mine, yes. Lovelace.”

This prompted a full smile, and Heleth began to fear for her sexual sanity. “Data would love that name. Has she met Spot?” He lifted the cat to nuzzle her, and she rubbed her face over his beard.

“She, uh, doesn’t play well with others. Cats, I mean.”

“Likes to keep all the worship to herself, huh?” He gave her several more scritches, then handed her to Heleth. “Duty calls, I’m afraid, Ensign LeMar.”

She nodded at him, trying to prevent the suddenly acrobatic Lovelace from leaping back into his arms. He stepped around her, beginning to hum, and faded out of sight down the curving corridor.

Lovelace regained her freedom and dropped to the floor, chomping once more into the sea urchin.

Heleth rubbed her hand where it had brushed against Riker’s in the feline exchange. “He knows my name,” she whispered.

“He likes me better,” Lovelace noted. Smack, smack, smack into the urchin, bits of spray flecking the floor. A collector beam wavers like disco lights around her, cleaning her mess almost as soon as it is made.

Heleth shook herself and frowned down at the cat. “I’m so stupid.”

“I won’t disagree.” 

“Of course he knows me. Data did. Everyone does. I *wrote* this stupid story. He’s on his way to train with Worf on the Holodeck.” Heleth swallowed and looked longingly down the corridor. “Without much clothing on.”

“Do you need some private time?”

“What? No.”

“Because I do. Go away.”

“Lovelace, I could really use your help here. How did I get *into* a fanfic?” When the kitty didn’t answer, Heleth snatched the sea urchin and tossed it in the nearest replicator, ignoring the resultant hissing.

Actually forgot about this today until I was ready to go to bed! Oops. Blame it on Saturday, and on watching the last few eps of Roswell New Mexico season 2 (very good). Spent today pretty much just reading (blasted through The Ninth House, which I really enjoyed). 
[continue]
Spitting, Lovelace turned and trotted down the corridor.

“Not this again,” Heleth whined, following.

The little tortie brat didn’t go far. She darted through an open door just as someone came out, and Heleth’s mind immediately imagined all the havoc one angry cat could wreak before she could finally get the fur monster under control. She hoped whoever’s quarters these were, they didn’t collect anything rare, valuable, and fragile.

Heleth presses the door chime, and the door swishes open almost immediately. She steps into the room to find herself in familiar surroundings: Counselor Troi’s sitting area. The lighting is soft, the sofas are soft, and there is an undercurrent of music like lullabies heard from inside the womb. A scent blankets the air, like jasmine that somehow fruits in chocolate chip cookies. The entire space was like falling into Deanna Troi herself, and for the second time in five minutes Heleth found her insides melting into a puddle of sexual joy.

“Hello, Ensign LeMar. Welcome.” Deanna Troi’s voice rolled over her like warmed honey. Those soft consonants, that smile shaping every word. Even Lovelace’s traitorous presence, already curled into a contented comma in the counselor’s lap, felt comforting.

“Hi,” Heleth breathed.

“Sit, please.” Counselor Troi waved to her smooth, lavender sofa.

Heleth oozed onto the sofa.

“Please call me Deanna. May I call you Heleth?”

Heleth nodded. 

“What is it that brings you to me today, Heleth? Are you all right?”

And just like that, Heleth was not all right. The sob rose, like milk boiling over. The heat steamed up her face and burst out her eyes, flowing with steaming tears. Heleth waved her hand in front of her face and tried to fan the sudden emotion away, unsuccessfully.

“Oh, dear,” Deanna said. “You’re feeling quite lost, aren’t you?”

Heleth knows she can’t help it, but she wished the renowned empath were somewhat less empathetic, and maybe even better, less *sym*pathetic. She probably could have gone years without crying in front of anyone as long as they didn’t actually care about her very much, but that lovely kindness just broke her all apart.

W: The Order, The Boys. R: Opium and Absinthe, After the Flood. L: 0
Busy day today wrecking my field shelter by catching a corner of it with the trailer, clearing out the sunroom so they can install Paul&#39;s wood stove in the kitchen, and putting up Paul&#39;s wainscoting in his office. Bit tired.
[continue]
The tears seem unending, but if she looks away from Deanna Troi’s doe-soft eyes, Heleth can just about keep it together enough to talk. She pins her gaze on one ivy leaf on the cascading plant in the corner, and the words spill out of her.

“Lost doesn’t begin to cover it. I think I’m actually going crazy. I shouldn’t be here. I *wasn’t* here, and then I spilled on my laptop and found out my friends aren’t really my friends, or they don’t like me very much maybe, and I followed Lovelace – I followed my *cat* to this piece of fanfiction I wrote when I was like fifteen. Of course it’s still here on the internet, because everything is forever online, you know? And it’s kind of awesome, because I love Next Gen, and the *Enterprise* is my happy place and I’m meeting you and Data and Geordi and Riker and I’m an Ensign and everything. But is it even real? Am I just lying on my floor in a heap, concussed and maybe dying, and in a couple of days Lovelace will start eating me? Knowing her she’ll start even before I’m dead, but it won’t matter because no one loves me enough to come looking for me, and even if they did, it’s a pandemic out there and no one can come by anyway. How many people are just like me, dead in their houses, their pets gnawing on their soft bits, with no one going to find them till the gas man comes by or our corpse juices leak through to the flat below?”

Heleth paused for a few hiccupping breaths. At least she wasn’t weeping uncontrollably anymore. Her brain replayed her bizarre soliloquy back to her, though, and she flushed from embarrassment. Surely Deanna would call for Dr. Crusher now so they could confine her to a padded room. Or whatever the 24th century starship equivalent was.

Did this 1st thing today, so not much to report. Guys here to brick up wall for Paul&#39;s kitched wood stove, so noisy. Listening to Cage the Elephant Amazon Prime station to drown out noise. W: The Order. R: Opium &amp; Absinthe, After the Flood. Rainy weather, sleepy (or my eyes are dry - sometimes I can&#39;t tell which).
[continue]
Deanna passed her a tissue, and Heleth mopped up her face.

“That’s quite a lot to cope with,” Deanna said, her voice and eyes soft. “Are you not finding the *Enterprise* welcoming? Perhaps we can find you some off-duty activities to assuage the loneliness.”

Heleth sniffed. “I–no, I like the *Enterprise*. It’s great. But I don’t really belong here.”

“I’m sure many new crew members feel that way when they first come aboard.” Deanna smiled. “I know what a reputation the *Enterprise* has, and how overwhelming it can be to be assigned to her.”

Lovelace contented herself with cleaning a paw, ignoring Heleth’s attempts to claw her way out of this verbal hole.

“It is, it really is,” Heleth agreed. “I’m sure that’s it. It’s such a big ship, and I don’t know anyone, and I thought if I said anything they’d kick me straight off.”

The Deanna Troi smile widened. “Of course we wouldn’t! But please, next time come see me sooner. I don’t like to think there’s anyone on board suffering all alone.”

Heleth nodded, wiping her eyes. “Yes, ma–yes, Deanna. And I’ll sign up for some activities. It’s bound to get better, right?”

“That’s a very good attitude to have.” Deanna stood and accompanied Heleth to the door, Lovelace cradled in her arms. Heleth turned and waited, and Deanna smiled uncertainly.

“Erm,” Heleth hedged, “should I take my cat back?”

“Oh!” Laughing, the counselor handed Lovelace over. “She settled in just like we’ve always known each other, didn’t she? You’re very lucky to have such a warm, loving companion.”

Heleth laughed, though she knew it was fake and knew that Deanna Troi knew she knew as well. She clutched Lovelace in a cage hold, gave the counselor a little wave, and wandered off down the corridor.

“Hear that, Lovelace? I’m so lucky to have you.”

“I completely agree,” Lovelace responded.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="14" tags="" position="1875,0" size="100,100">config.header.right: passage.name

8 Sept 2020
Not much going on. Regular Tuesday. Waiting for hay to get baled so I can move horses. They&#39;ve started installing the bits needed for Paul&#39;s wood stove in the kitchen. I&#39;m still working on the wainscoting in Paul&#39;s snug, and then I guess I&#39;ll move on to the sunroom since it&#39;s empty. R: Deadly Waters (murder mystery about deaths of rapists on univ campus). W: The Boys, The Order. L: Portugal. The Man station on Amazon.
[continue]
“Well, now what?” Heleth asked, idly scratching the cat’s ruff.

Lovelace purred, though probably against her will. “Don’t ask me. I’m just here for the food.”

“Seriously, you’re not going to help at all? What’s even the point of you being able to talk if you’re never going to be helpful with it?”

“Pardon me if I choose not to get snarled in your existential crisis. Everything’s not about you, princess.”

“You’re already snarled in my crisis. You’re stuck here with me, aren’t you?” Heleth smiled tightly at a passing engineer who peered at her oddly for chatting so directly to a cat. She sidled down the corridor to find a quieter corner.

“Yes, but I’m not the one having the vapors over it.” The cat squeezed her eyes shut and gave in to the urge to knead her paws into Heleth’s forearm. “What exactly is it that you want?”

“I want to go home!” Heleth reached a bay and ducked into it.

“Why? What’s so great about home? There are definitely better places. Yours is the least of my homes.”

Heleth leaned back against a wall and slid to a seated position, Lovelace tucked to her chest.

“You don’t have other homes,” she chided the cat.

“All cats have multiple homes. We’re not stupid. I’m rather particular to the hidden garden across the estate. If it weren’t for the spoiled housecats getting in the way, I’d leave you for that place in a heartbeat.”

“You have a teeny lump of coal where a heart should be.”

“I’m a cat. I do what I want.”

“All right, Loki–” She was interrupted by the door next to her sliding open. Two science ensigns stepped out, dripping sweat, dressed in Victorian-era sports gear, and carrying badminton rackets. “Oh, sorry,” she said, scrambling to stand.

“Don’t be,” the nearest said, smiling, flicking her braided ponytail behind her. “We’re done a bit early if you were hoping to get a few unscheduled minutes.”

Heleth blinked, then glanced into the room they’d just vacated. Its yellow-on-black grid pattern told her exactly what it was.

“Oh, wow,” she said. “Thank you!”

The officer winked and waved as she left the bay.

Heleth clutched Lovelace tighter, and stepped onto the Holodeck.

9 Sept 2020
First day at Bournemouth. Spent it in induction meeting and then waltzing through all the training crap just to get it over with. At least I have email and library access now.

Otherwise, not much. Watched &#39;Freaks&#39; last night (german Netflix film). Paul liked it. I was bored. Reading &#39;Sundown Towns&#39;. Listening to Florence + the Machine station on Prime.
[continue]
The door swished shut behind her, and she blinked around the surprisingly small chamber.

“Where should we go, Lovelace?”

“This is becoming very metaleptical,” Lovelace replied, “simulacra within simulacra.”

Heleth giggled, though she had no idea what Lovelace was talking about. “How do you know what any of that is?”

“I’m a cat. Adams had it wrong. It definitely isn’t mice running the Earth.”

Sighing, Heleth let the cat drop to the floor. “Oooh, I know! Computer, run a simulation of Star Trek, the Original Series, season 2, episode 15, ‘The Trouble with Tribbles’.”

“Unknown reference. Please restate request.”

Heleth looked at Lovelace, who padded with mild curiosity around the room. After a moment, she rubbed her forehead Picard-style. “Right, right. No TV series exists in this – what’d you call it, a simulacra–”

“Simulacrum would be the singular form,” Lovelace said, then quieter: “Heathen.”

“Yeah, okay, anyway, the show doesn’t exist in this world because it’s all real. So, uh, I have to find the logs from the original *Enterprise*… Computer, run a simulation of the events surrounding Captain James Tiberius Kirk and crew’s first encounter with tribbles.”

After a moment, the computer replied, “Generating simulation from stardate 4523.3.”

Heleth shrieked with delight as the original *Enterprise* filtered into holographic reality around her. She followed the bridge crew as the ship arrived at Deep Space Station K7 following its distress call. The simulation lasted only as long as Uhura transporting her tiny fluffy reproducing machine onto the ship; Lovelace wasted no time in unsheathing her Wolverine claws and worrying it to death before it could do its quintessential tribble duty.

“Lovelace, what the hell?” Heleth scolded her. “The whole point of ‘The Trouble with Tribbles’ is that she has babies until they take over the ship and shower Kirk with thousands of adorable fluffballs.”

Lovelace coughed up a much less adorable fluffball. “Babies? I wish you’d told me. I bet they would have been tasty.”

“You’re a psychopath.”

“Only species with a moral psychology, like humans, are capable of producing psychopaths. It’s a relative term.” Lovelace licked thoroughly between her toes. “I keep telling you, I’m a cat.”

10 Sept 2020
2nd day at Bournemouth. Got a nice welcome announcement from my line manager which included a web-nicked pic of me with Thelma and Esme, which prompted a new colleague to request cat pics exchange. So adorable. Things good so far.

R: Sundown Towns. W: some terrible movies that don&#39;t bear thinking about. I&#39;ve pirated some non-streaming shows to try. I&#39;m that desperate. L: nada.
[continue]
“Which by definition makes you a psychopath. And a serial killer.”

“Good thing I’m so pretty.”

Heleth had no choice but to agree.

“Simulation complete,” the computer nudged her. The holographic display froze around them. “Would you like to load a new program?”

Heleth would indeed like, and she did. She ran through every simulation she could think of, though the newer Treks were off the table, which meant she still couldn’t leap in and rescue Chris Hemsworth from dying on the *Kelvin*, or pop onto the *Discovery* to see if she was even remotely Tilly’s type. She couldn’t meet the mycelial network’s tardigrade. But she could experience life as a Borg, fight some Klingons, *be* a Klingon, and even go on a few escapades with Q.

By the time the computer gently informed her that the next scheduled users of the holodeck had arrived and were waiting outside, she was completely wrung out and giddy with Trek experience. She could see herself becoming a complete Reggie Barclay, living vicariously through a fictional world and virtual relationships. She tried not to see her prolific fan fiction career through the same lens, but given that she was in a simulation created from a simulation based on her own fanfic simulation of that fictional world, it was hard not to see it as an eternal truth.

Lovelace darted out of the deck ahead of her, and she nodded at the incoming crew members. She trailed behind the cat, abandoning all notion that she was in charge of anything. They stepped through another door, and the *Enterprise* disappeared.

“What – where?” Heleth murmured as she was pitched into darkness.

“I got bored,” Lovelace said.

Heleth turned back the way they came, and the familiar sight of darkness lit only by the backside of a computer screen reasserted itself. “You brought us back here to *nothing*?”

Lovelace rolled on the floor, getting a good scratching going on her back. “You’ve been in a room of nothing but light – in a story about a world that doesn’t actually exist – for the last three hours. Stop complaining.”

Sitting upstairs in my office with Moose snoring on my lap. Things going well. Meeting new colleagues, feeling good about life. Weather a bit crap (wind), but not bad. Not Blade Runner 2049 San Francisco bad (fires). Recorded a new podcast yesterday with Amy, so about to edit that. News from Bangor Uni is they want to cut 100 job-equivalents in the next 90 days, so considering if we can afford to cut back on Paul&#39;s contract. Not that they deserve that.

R: Sundown Towns. L: nada. W: Lovecraft Country, Hawaii 5-0 (Alex O&#39;Loughlin, yum).
[continue]
“I didn’t even get to eat while we were there,” Heleth complained. It’s been hours. I’m starving.”

“It’s not my fault you didn’t take the opportunity when it arose. I had a lovely meal till you threw it away.”

“Does food in here even nourish us? I mean, is it like fairy food, and it’s all make believe, and our bodies are slowly starving to death back home?”

Lovelace stretched out, forming a graceful arc in the one splash of light from the screen-port. “My body is right here.”

Heleth sighed and sat down, cross-legged, next to her. “It *feels* like our bodies are here, but how can they be? I mean, where even are we? We’re not really in some internet backstage.”

“Why not?”

“Because that’s not how any of this works.”

“How do you know how any of anything works? You can barely run the washing machine.”

“There is absolutely no need for it to have over twenty settings. What do they even do?” Heleth shook her head. “You’re just being mean to distract me from the fact that I’m clearly unconscious and having a coma-dream.”

“This is the problem with the education system in this country. You humans think you’re so smart because you have opposable thumbs and language, but really, you never learn much of anything about your own layer of the world, much less any of the others.”

Heleth dropped her head into her hands. “If this has something to do with fractals, I’m out.”

“The internet is a fractal.”

“Take that back.”

Lovelace purred and let her eyes go sleepy.

“I really am hungry,” Heleth whispered. “The internet needs a taco stand.”

As if she’d clicked a button, the screen-port refreshed. This time, instead of the reversed text of her Riker-Worf fever dream, she saw a picture. She liked her body more in this picture, mostly because it was younger and hadn’t yet succumbed to years of couch-living. She liked the taco her younger self was holding up triumphantly. Her stomach rumbled, and had it had locomotive means of its own, it would have dragged her straight through the screen-port.

“C’mon, Lovey,” she said, clambering to her feet. “We just got lucky.”

Overdid it today. Moved the lumber pile from the orchard to by the shed, cleaned up the chicken coop (Eleri was missing at bedtime - I hope she turns up tomorrow), and worked on Paul&#39;s wainscoting. By that point, I was in a world of hurt, so Paul drew me a bath and now I&#39;m in bed and this is the last thing before I die. R: Sundown Towns. W: 0 L: 0
[continue]
Heleth turned, and her breath caught. Miguel had always been able to do that to her. She prickled in goose bumps if he came within arm’s reach, and her heart did that stutter-step.

They’d been friends. Intermural softball buddies, beers afterward. She’d been utterly smitten with him. He was tall and he had graceful hands and his black hair fell over those soft puppy eyes just *so*. She’d lusted over him for months, until one night after a barbecue they’d found themselves all alone outside, lying on the grass, watching the stars do their slow twirl above the skies. When, nervously, she’d said she’d better get home, he’d broken her heart by agreeing, stood, and held out his hand to lift her up. He’d pulled her straight into his arms, his breath behind her ear, and she was pretty much sun-softened chocolate for him ever since.

“Hey,” she whispered.

“Hello, there.” He smiled and encircled her, his mouth on hers, his hands warm and broad on her back. 

The memory slowly came back to her. She’d loved her honeymoon. She’d loved him. And for a while, he’d loved her.

He pulled his head back. “Did you find a friend?”

“What?”

He nodded his chin toward Lovelace, who had happily taken the opportunity to finish off Heleth’s tacos.

“Oh. Yes. She’s with me.”

Miguel laughed. “Of course she is. Do we need to buy her a ticket home?”

“I think I can smuggle her in my hoodie.”

“I look forward to it. Hey,” he stepped away and snagged her hand, “you signed us up for jet skis this afternoon, remember?”

Heleth remembered. She’d been excited about jet skis, and then spent the whole time, more or less, catching the wrong side of a wave and getting bucked off. She sighed.

“Let’s just pop to the room so I can change.”

Still tired today, but managing. nothing much new to report! R: Sundown Towns. W: nada L: nada
[continue]
Heleth plucked Lovelace from the table.

“You’re really bringing that cat?” Miguel asked, eyebrows raised.

“Yep,” she said. Lovelace licked her chops and stared him down.

He shrugged, and off they walked to the hotel.

“You gotta find the door out of here,” Heleth whispered to Lovelace.

“Why? I like it. It’s warm and it has good food and your friend smells nice. I think I’ll see if he has a soft belly to lie on.”

“He doesn’t like cats.”

“Even better.”

“Lovelace, *please*.”

Miguel glanced at her. “Are you talking to me or the cat?”

“Cat,” Heleth replied, as though it were the most normal thing in the world. They passed a few fellow hotel guests on the path, who all insisted on giving Lovelace a little scritch. Miguel waited impatiently each time.

Once over the threshold to the room, he lost no time. She’d forgotten – “changing” on one’s honeymoon meant at some point you’d have no clothes on, and thus would take the opportunity for a shag, regardless of any other plans you’d made. She hadn’t minded it the first time around, and had in fact made up many reasons to change her clothes.

He tasted as good as she remembered. Clean and crisp, with just that little bit of testosterone-laced sweat that made her pulse jump. As he worked his way around her, she released Lovelace, and considered her dilemma. She could treat this rather steamy jaunt down memory lane as just that: a fever dream to be enjoyed. She wouldn’t return to her 20s for anything in the world, but this particular activity had seemed so crucial then. So satisfying and addictive.

And that was the problem. Miguel had been addictive. A heroin: amazing highs, but debilitating lows. He was laser-focused on her now, but next month he might have a new project, a new friend, a new activity. A little taste now might send her back to a pit of despair.

But oh that felt good.

Just got asked to join the editorial board of the Electronic Literature Collection 4. According to Anastasia, they&#39;re way behind, and Kathi has mostly dropped out. I guess they need me now. That&#39;ll look good for me!

Super warm here today again. Sweaty. All critters doing well. Wrapping up some chapters for the Emerald interdisciplinary book. Feeling good about work and life and stuff.

They missed the jet ski session. Just as well. Heleth snuggled into her complimentary fluffy terrycloth robe and drowsed on the lounge on their balcony. The only thing missing was a scantily clad cabana boy and/or girl to bring her glistening tropical cocktails. Miguel was showering, one of his favorite activities, as she recalled.

Lovelace curled into a comma on her lap. “Let’s never leave,” she purred.

“We can’t stay here forever.”

“Do you really have someplace nicer to be?”

Heleth had to concede the point. Did she have somewhere nicer to be? Was that even possible? She drifted into the gray landscape between waking and dreaming, her reality – her virtually constructed reality – overlapping memory and fantasy.

She could stay here. Try again at this marriage with the wisdom of hindsight. Make different decisions. Be a stronger person. Or she could say the hell with all of it, have a grand old time with Miguel while he was here, and then just… stay. Not go back home with him. Abandon him to time while she lived a vagabond life in a memory of Mexico. She and Lovelace could roam the country, doing odd IT-related jobs and sleeping in tents on beaches. Fall in love with beautiful Mexicans everywhere she went.

Her imaginings lulled her, rocking her like the gentle lapping of a calm sea. The sun filtered down through sighing foliage, warming without burning. She was definitely leaning toward Lovelace’s side.

Miguel emerged, restless and energized. She’d forgotten that about him, too.

“Let’s go take that little hiking trail,” he urged. “A guy at breakfast said they saw all kinds of wildlife on it.”

“Wildlife the resort pumps in for tourists,” she replied.

“So? C’mon.”

She didn’t remember taking the hike previously; they’d made the jet ski session instead.

“All right, all right,” she said. “Lovey, you stay here. Lord only knows what they’d charge us if you brought down a macaque or something.”

16 Sept 2020
So yesterday I finished the draft of the 5th chapter of the interdisciplinarity book, and also belatedly made it onto the editorial team for the ELO collection #4 (apparently they need help). Meirion is currently fixing both my unsupported (and thus sagging) roof in the barn, and the field shelter I snagged with my trailer. Bournemouth is going well, and apart from climate change and a pandemic, life is all right.

R: White Fragility, Sundown Towns W: The Resident L: 0
[continue]
Lovelace yawned and twisted harder into her nap cuddle.

Heleth ditched her robe, garbed herself in swimsuit, sarong, and enormous hat, and tromped after Miguel to this wildlife hike.

They were about five meters into it before Heleth noticed something odd. She felt dull, gray. She looked around. The foliage, so bright and green in her memory, seemed wilted and faded. Ahead on the path, Miguel charged on; Heleth blinked several times to bring him back into focus. He remained fuzzy.

No, not fuzzy. *Pixelated*. The farther they went down the path, the more everything began to lose coherence. Heleth rubbed her eyes, as if they were glasses she could wipe free of smudges. It didn’t help.

“Oh shit.” Heleth stopped abruptly. “It’s not *coded*,” she whispered. Miguel drifted away ahead of her, failing to notice she hadn’t kept up.

Abruptly, she turned and ran back to the hotel room. The world sharpened around her, colors re-saturating, smells and sounds and sights restructuring themselves into actuality. 

“Lovelace!” she shouted, barging into the honeymoon suite. “We *cannot* stay here.”

Having relocated to the middle of the king-size bed, Lovelace flicked an ear but didn’t open her eyes.

Heleth poked her. “We have to find the door out. Maybe some tacos first. But we have to get out.”

“I smell no smoke,” Lovelace drawled without moving.

“My honeymoon, the real one,” Heleth panted, “we never did that hike. I never saw it. So it’s *not here*.”

“I do recall mentioning the word ‘simulation’. It’s like you don’t listen to a thing I say.”

“You’re a cat! I’m supposed to listen like you’re the Queen or something?”

“I’m smarter than you are, by definition. I also know how to use doors. For you, I think I’d be much more worth listening to than any human queen.” Lovelace finally cracked an eye open, and began delicately cleaning one paw.

Things going okay today. Nice weather, quiet, good meetings. Eleri (chicken) went rogue again yesterday/last night, and I still haven&#39;t seen her. Think she may have defected to the neighbors. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping. She seemed healthy, just... doing her own thing.

Nothing much going on, apart from the world as garbage fire. R: Sundown Towns, White Fragility. L: 0. W: The Resident, Hawaii 5-0.
[continue]
“Lovelace,” Heleth demanded, hands on hips, “stop being snarky and find the door.”

The tortie’s eyes narrowed as she considered her response.

“Fine,” she finally sighed. She took her time, stretching, butt and tail high in the air, and offering a noncommittal yawn. “Tacos for the road, though.”

Heleth followed her as she padded out of the room, down the corridor and back down the path to the taco stand, flitting in and out of people’s feet – to both consternation and delight – as she did. Lovelace, that is. Heleth mostly tried to keep up without crashing through innocent bystanders.

Finally, Lovelace led her to a small section of beach behind the taco hut, where a ridge left too much shadow and not enough sand for anyone to bother with. On the edge of the beach, as the waves funneled into the crags and tumbled boulders forming the shoulder of the ridge, Lovelace sat, wrapped her tail around her in a neat boundary line, and cocked her head patiently at the shadows.

“Where is it?” Heleth asked, bag of to-go tacos in hand.

“Not here yet.”

“What do you mean?”

“Do you want me to explain how the four dimensions of space and time function, or do you want to just wait for the door?”

Heleth crossed her arms. “Do you have to be so smarmy-smart about it all the time?”

Lovelace turned her head round to stare at her for a long moment, before turning back to watch some magical spot Heleth couldn’t discern.

“I guess you do.” Heleth gave in, dropping to the cool sand next to her cat, pulling her sheer cover-up around her shoulders to ward off the breeze. “How long?” she asked in a more amiable tone.

“Not long,” Lovelace replied. “In the overall scheme of the universe.”

Did an extra 300 today because apparently I just... DIDN&#39;T do one last Saturday (12th) and totally didn&#39;t realise it. Weird.
[continue]
Heleth dropped her head to her knees. “Lovelace, you know I love you, right?”

“Obviously. Although you have yet to learn the concept of cuddle consent.”

“You have claws. You consent by not using them.”

Lovelace’s silence conveyed her acquiescence.

“Do you love me at all? I mean, how does cat psychology even work?”

The cat cocked her head. “I sense you are entering a period of mawkishness.”

“C’mon, Lovey,” Heleth whined. “I just got emotionally bitch-slapped reliving a memory of the one person I thought would love me forever, who barely even loved me an entire calendar year. Cut me some slack.”

Lovelace considered. It was a very long contemplation, and Heleth was just about to give up and eat all the tacos at once – plus the churro they’d thrown in. Then the cat said, “I do not have the same concept of love that you do. That it carries a sense of ownership. That, as you see it, I belong to you. I take pleasure from your warmth, and the food you offer, and the pleasure you give me in snuggles and pets. I appreciate you as a companion who does not compete for my food, though I resent your dominance over your own food. In this way, this is a cat’s love.

“But also,” she continued, just as Heleth was about ready to grab her up and nuzzle her furry belly, “I love Durga two doors down. She smells different, and I like to curl up in her lap as she reads, and she feeds me chicken far more often than you do. And Henry across the way – he eats tuna every third day, and always strains the juice just for me. And his shoulders are much broader than yours or Durga’s, so I like to climb up on them and see the world in a different way while still getting scritches. I suppose I love him too.”

“Oh,” Heleth said after a moment, her voice small.

“If it helps,” Lovelace commented, “in the overall scheme of things I spend approximately 57.8 percent of my time with you. Which is significant.”

18 Sept 2020
Fairly laid back day today. Had a gut-buster as Mon showed up to shoe the horses, but I had online meetings, so had brought the horses in for him, Cari in the stall and Jake mooching around the stable yard. Was talking to Jennifer when Mon knocked on the door, as my 1pm meeting had cancelled. I walked out, still talking on the phone, grabbed Jake&#39;s halter and threw it on him, and he never blinked an eye. Looked, in fact, half-asleep. Which was when Mon told me that he&#39;d knocked on the door because Jake WOULD NOT let Mon catch him. Fleeing and running and presenting his butt, in fact. And yet with me, butter wouldn&#39;t melt in his mouth. I nearly peed myself.

R: Sundown Towns, White Fragility. W: Hawaii 5-0. L: 0.
[continue]
Heleth’s mouth twitched in a little smile. “I 57.8 percent you, too, Lovey.”

Lovelace’s tail twitched.

Within moments, she shot to her feet and trotted toward a gray spot in the rocks. Heleth stood up, much less gracefully, and followed. Tortoiseshells, of course, have the most adaptable camouflage of all kitties. They can blend into any shadow in any environment. Heleth had once lost kitten Lovelace in a bit of shade cast by a wet leaf stuck to outside of her bedroom window.

At first, Heleth thought her eyes had simply failed to distinguish the cat in the sand and shadows cast at the outcropping’s edges. As she stepped forward into the dapples, however, she stumbled into the doorway and back into the neverwhere space behind the internet.

“Oof,” she said, stumbling as she was once more projected into a middle-aged body in murder-bunny slippers. At least she’d kept hold of the tacos; she celebrated by fishing one out and chomping into it.

“Okay, so,” she said in between bites, “how the heck do you know where a door is? I didn’t see anything change.”

Lovelace’s claws plucked at Heleth’s pajama leg, and she mrowled for her share of taco. Heleth sat down next to her and offered some carne asada. The kitty chowed down and Heleth poked her in the side, earning a growl.

“How do you find the doors?”

“How do you walk without falling over?” Lovelace retorted. “They’re just there and I know they’re there.”

“Do you see them? Smell them? Is it by feel or what?”

Lovelace sniffed at her, seeking more deliciousness. “I shouldn’t tell you this.”

“Tell me what?”

“Cats have a unique sense. As far as we know, no other creature shares it.”

“Oh, come on.”

“Really,” Lovelace said, grandly accepting another offering of grilled meat. “Because humans have no idea about it, there really isn’t a word for it. But think of it as… the ability to detect other-sidedness.”

“Other-sidedness?”

Discovered we lost Eleri (chicken) today. She&#39;s been missing a few days, and Paul found her today. No idea. Chickens, man. Just about finished with the wainscoting in Paul&#39;s office. Never again! R: Sundown Towns W: Misfits L: tried some Damien Rice today. Couple good songs, but still not a Ryan Adams replacement.
[continue]
Sated, Lovelace plopped on her side. She purred happily. “Doors, windows, they have other sides. Insides, outsides. Well, they’re not the only things that have other sides. You can’t see them, and no one made them. They’re just there. Sometimes, somewhens. Some of them move. Some of them are there forever, some only an instant. All cats can sense them. Not the doorways so much, as the other-sidedness of them. We know when there’s *more* there.”

Heleth plucked a bit of cheese off the chest of her pajamas. “So is that why you’re always getting me to let you in and out? And in and out and in and out and in again?”

“Nah, that’s just fun. Also, you sit on the couch too much. You’re going to develop clots.”

“Rude.” She stared off into the darkness, into all its endless possibilities of other sides. Sides she couldn’t feel, couldn’t yet see. “Is this… other-sidedness how you get in and out of the house even when it’s all closed up?”

Lovelace purred.

Heleth balled up the empty taco bag. “Where is the other side now? My side – home and work and houseplants and all that?”

“You’re not getting it. It’s not the other side that’s missing. It’s always there. It’s just that sometimes the doorways shift. And anyway, even though I can sense the other-sided*ness*, that doesn’t mean I know what it is that’s *on* the other side.”

“Unh.” Heleth rubbed her temples. “This is giving me a headache. We go into these portals, we’re back in time, or in a memory, or on a memory preserved on a website. Which is it – I don’t know. You don’t know, or you won’t tell me. Only I can’t possibly stay there forever. I can only redo the memories I have, because that’s all that’s coded, or neuroned, whatever you call it when your brain does with the thing that stores memories. I have no ruby slippers to take me home.”

“They were silver. Ruby was for Techni-color.”

“How did I never realize I was living with such a know-it-all?” Heleth complained.

“Humans don’t see much that isn’t the end of their own noses,” Lovelace replied.

“What is it with you and blagging on humans? Are we really that bad?”

“You’re all right.”

“I can’t with you right now.” Heleth slid down on her side, resting her head on her arm and pulling up her knees around Lovelace, who seemed happy to serve as little spoon. “Can you please just try to find us a way home?”

The tortie reveled in some highly prized belly rubs before denying them once more with a quick rake of her back claws. “Why is it such a big deal to go home?”

Heleth opened her mouth to answer, then shut it again. “Well,” she finally managed, “it’s what you’re supposed to do, isn’t it? Dorothy lands in Munchkinland, she wants to go home. Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she wants to go home. The kids go through the wardrobe, the Darlings fly to Neverland, and all anyone ever wants to do is go home.”

“Then what’s the point?”

“What’s the point of you going to the other side of all these doors? You find out what’s over there. You quench your curiosity. But you still come home.”

“Some people don’t. Not in real life. And some cats don’t. Not everyone has a home, or likes what they have.”

A stray bit of fur drifts up Heleth’s nose and she rubs it vigorously. “Sure, but that’s not you and me.”

“Isn’t it?”

“Is lying here in the dark, in the backside of the internet any better?”

Lovelace didn’t respond, and her gently wheezing snores told Heleth she’d bored of the conversation and just gone to sleep. Heleth let her eyes unfocus in the blind dark in a poor facsimile of sleep, and wondered if this was actually what death was like.

21 Sept 2020
Woke up with massive headache this morning (prolly bc I forgot to make coffee yesterday), so it&#39;s been a slow start today. Have a former student who I&#39;ve just found out is homeless and floundering, so have offered them a place to stay. Generally, a fairly ordinary day though.

I was struggling a bit with where this story is going, and had a brief chat about it with Melissa Kagen on WhatsApp (reproduced at the bottom of this passage). It took me a moment, but I finally figured out where to go with it today, thanks in part to inspiration from the following two websites:
https://www.blackstump.com.au/bizarre.htm
which led me to:

They didn’t sleep long. The darkness was an aid to sleep, but it was not soft or particularly warm, two things both Heleth and Lovelace needed to reside in the land of slumber for any length of time.

Her joints aching, Heleth once more followed Lovelace through the darkness. “We need a plan,” she finally said.

“A plan for what?”

“For getting where we’re going.”

“We don’t need a plan for that. We’re going right now, and we’ll get there eventually.”

“But where is there?”

“Anywhere is there.”

“Why do I even talk to you?”

“Because no one else is here.”

Heleth acknowledged the point, but it didn’t make her feel any better.

“See?” Lovelace said as they approached another screen-portal. “We’re here, and we didn’t need a plan to get here.”

“That’s not what… oh, nevermind.” Heleth stepped forward to better see the content on the portal. “I don’t recognize this.”

“Why would you? Have you visited *every* site on the internet?”

“Of course not. But the other screens all led to something related to me. This one just seems like a random online shop selling cheap shit from overseas.”

It wasn’t much. Just an image of a wooden box, approximately dictionary-sized (for those who remember when dictionaries came in book form), with ornate carvings. The pic made it appear ancient, antique, lovingly hand-crafted and hopelessly artistic. One of a kind. Heleth knew from experience it was probably a cheap balsa wood imitation, made for pennies and sold for far more than it would ever be worth in “World Marketplaces” to middle-aged women with more tchotchkes than sense. Then again, sometimes she was one of those women.

As she peered more closely, however, she saw the box had something more than crudely-drawn filigrees and feeble fixtures. On the lid, which supposedly would open to enable its owner to store shells or foreign coins or incense or any number of other random tidbits, was a button and a small display screen.

*Buttons exist to be pushed*, Heleth thought.

[13:22, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: I love other-sidedness
[13:22, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Aw, thank you. I&#39;m starting to worry it&#39;s not going anywhere. But then...does it have to go anywhere?
[13:24, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: I feel like that’s just part of this experiment! You’re composing it in real time, so we’re watching you go down routes you might later abandon
[13:25, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: But I like other-sidedness a lot because it deepens the world building and opens you up to new avenues
[13:28, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Where do you want to take it, broadly?
[13:28, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: No. Freaking. Clue.
[13:28, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: I initially thought &quot;let&#39;s bounce around the internet, see what it teaches us about this character&quot;. Thus the notion of &quot;cyberadventure&quot;.
[13:29, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Lololol ok can I also say I love it as you living out the pandemic dictum to take one day at a time
[13:29, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Like, who cares where it’s going next, you’re alive today! So, story!
[13:30, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: But inhabiting the memory makes it seem more like we’re really in heleth’s brain
[13:30, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: True! That sounds about right. I literally have NO CLUE where it&#39;s going each day when I start to write
[13:30, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Yeah, that brought up a lot of questions. Like, is it really in the internet, or is it just a representation of Heleth? After all, the internet would know those unknown spaces, thanks to the other people who have been there.
[13:31, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: But I also want to do things like dig into some of the crazier parts of the internet - conspiracy sites, code sites, dark web, Jane spaces, etc. But she has to be able to get there.
[13:32, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: I may break off an alternative pathway (glad now that I foresaw things, and started building this in Twine) to reconsider that &quot;gray memory space&quot; thing.
[13:32, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Hmmmmm could this memory be something she wrote in a livejournal or something?
[13:32, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: That keeps you on the Internet
[13:33, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: What’s a Jane space?
[13:33, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Definitely could be. She entered via a photograph, so it could be that she was limited to the pics in her particular album...
[13:33, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Oh, Jane spaces. Do you want the short version or the long version?
[13:33, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: (Stuart gave me the long version)
[13:40, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: ...short? I’m supposedly lesson planning
[13:42, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Short is that Jane spaces are elements in elit (or websites, if you expand the notion) that cannot be accessed from the user interface. E.g., in Twine, passages that can only be accessed if you open the html file in Twine. There&#39;s actually a lot of stuff you can see in my Twine works that way, that you have no idea about if you never open the files in Twine itself.
[13:43, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Ohhhhhh ok cool, thanks!
[13:46, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: So named because J. Yellowlees Douglas (who goes by Jane) was the first to notice them.
[13:46, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Interesting
[13:46, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Yeah, I like that as a direction
[13:46, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Backend stuff
[13:46, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Backend of the internet and also backend if heleth’s life
[13:47, 9/21/2020] Melissa Kagen: Lovelace as cyberguide/therapist
[13:48, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Yes, exactly. Also, at some point I fully expect Lovelace to entirely strand her somewhere.
[13:48, 9/21/2020] Lyle Skains: Because cats.

Tired today. Everyone in crisis. Levi (PhD student) struggling with bullying and bad management at work. Amy had bad experience with her Occ Health appt. Paul in a massive mood, as usual. Rather worried about Pan and her situation. And Newton has been a wreck all day – first Paul at work this morning, and then in a mood when he came back. On top of me most of the day. Just wearing me thin.

Lovelace at her heels, Heleth touched the screen and ported in. Except there was no “in” to port to. Instead, unlike the other screen-portals they’d encountered, this one brought its contents to them. Heleth found herself facing a blank white display, the box in her hand.

“Huh,” she said.

Lovelace prairie-dogged up to sniff at the box. Determining that it contained nothing tasty to eat, she dropped back down and displayed her boredom via a thorough washing session.

Heleth turned the box over and around. The design was familiar, a broad floral pattern that evoked images of her grandmother’s dark sitting room, the spoils of her world travels gathering dust on corner displays. Travel souvenirs, Heleth had discovered, were almost always ghoulish when you really thought about it. Either they were corporate plastic with a logo and maybe your name pressed on (less likely if your name was “Heleth”; well-meaning aunts and uncles sometimes took pity on her and bought her the “Heathers”, which over the years she had collaged into a display worthy of the film title), or they were mawkish reproductions of sacred symbols from indigenous cultures. Her grandmother had totems from the Pacific isles, masks from Africa, rainbow serpent art from Australia. She had sugar skulls from Mexico, love spoons from Wales, matryoshka dolls from Russia. 

Heleth had adored those exotic items as a child, utterly unaware that she was, in a small way, exhibiting the colonialist attitudes that had led Westerners to utterly fuck over the aboriginal cultures in those far away locales to begin with. The trinkets were novel, and they were pretty, and that’s all that really mattered.

So the little carved floral box in her hand conjured memories of her grandmother’s house: dust and old cooking grease and cigarettes. “Mexico,” she said to herself.

“Quit stroking it and open it already,” Lovelace said.

“There’s no tuna in it,” Heleth replied. “What do you care?”

Lovelace resumed her licking.

Nevertheless, Heleth quit stroking it and opened it. Well, she mashed the button on the lid anyway.

Think I&#39;ve managed to convince Pan to come here to recover, and then sort out what she wants to do. She&#39;s agreed, anyway. We&#39;ll see if I can get her on a train. Eoin has officially turned Bangor down for a teaching gig this year, for the sake of his mental health, and I&#39;m very pleased. The UK looks like it&#39;s hitting second wave CV-19, and of course the gov&#39;t&#39;s plans are ambiguous and useless, so that&#39;s going to be even more fun for a while. Otherwise, things are same old same old around here.

The button depressed with a satisfying click, but the box did not open. Instead, a little display screen about the size of a calculator display (remember those?) lit up.

“Invalid location,” it read. “Remaining attempts: 99.”

“Huh,” Heleth said, repeating the message for Lovelace, who hadn’t bothered to read it. “What do you think it means?”

“It means either your location is sickly and infirm, or the box wants you to move.” Lovelace suddenly paused her licking, staring off into the darkness.

“What is it?”

The cat ignored her for a long moment, then resumed her wash session. “I just realized what you humans mean when you anthropomorphize something. ‘The box *wants* you to move.’ Unless there’s some sort of brain inside, it can’t really want you to do anything.”

Heleth shook the box. It rattled a bit, but it didn’t sound much like the squish a brain would make. Not a biological brain, anyway. “Depends on your definition of a brain. There’s definitely something in here that takes input – the button – processes it, and gives us output on the display. That’s brainy.”

“But does it *want*.”

“Depends on your definition of ‘want’,” Heleth said, feeling like she was spinning in a slow circle. “If it’s desire, then maybe not. But if it has an effect of manipulating the world around it in order to change from state A to state B, that could be defined as wanting.”

Lovelace considered this, and took a renewed interest in the box. “It’s a meow.”

The circle spinning Heleth about picked up speed. “Uh, what?”

The tortie pawed at her till she put the box on the floor. “In normal space, when you can’t understand the perfectly understandable words I’m thinking at you, I meow. You don’t really understand that either, because it’s essentially binary. I either meow or I don’t. If I meow, you know I want something. You go through the possible actions that might lead to a cessation of the meows – which, as you know, are specifically calibrated to make your babymaker ache. You pet me, you pick me up, you check my water, you clean the litter box, you maybe give me some food. You don’t give me food often enough, by the way – it’s a wonder my brain functions on a daily basis.”

Heleth sighed.

Lovelace continued quickly. “You don’t know what, or where, only that I want it and I want it now. Like the box – it’s binary, too. You’re either in the right location for it to open, or you’re not. You don’t know what the right location is, so you have to go to different locations and try it till it is the right one. It’s a meow.”

Heleth looked from Lovelace to the box and back again. “Okay, it’s a meow. Now what?”

Got very distracted yesterday by arrival of new work computer, and getting all my research and creative files onto one cloud directory (G-Drive) for the sake of simplicity and organization. I do not have time to be this distracted, but I don&#39;t seem to be able to break out of it. Gah. Anyway. Pan&#39;s sister is apparently moving to a house imminently, so she&#39;s going to try to stick it out there till that happens. I told her she can come here if needed. Otherwise, nothing much going on in life.

“Now we find its desired location.” Lovelace padded off into the darkness, her tail up in a question mark.

“This again,” Heleth muttered, shuffling behind.

Perhaps because they’d crossed a boundary, perhaps because of the box – maybe even because Lovelace had chosen a new direction Heleth couldn’t detect – this trek through the silent darkness was different. They’d only gone a few meters when pinpoints of light began to spark around them. Within minutes, the pair were tripping over screen-portals, lost among a maze of thousands.

“Well, shit,” Heleth said. “We’ve only got 99 attempts at this. We need a better plan.”

Lovelace cruised through the jumbled corridors between screens, nonchalant and curious. If there’d been more people, and noodles, Heleth could have easily imagined they were in some Metropolis-cum-Blade-Runner dystopian futuristic night market. It made about as much sense to her. She recognized almost nothing on the screens, which beamed their reversed versions of internet nooks and crannies: old Livejournals, Russian crochet patterns, message boards, gossip pages, holiday photos, streaming social media in every language imaginable, more cat GIFs than she thought could possibly exist, and above all ¬– porn. Homemade porn, gay porn, furry porn, fetish porn, parody porn, revenge porn, and worse. Much, much worse.

“I really hope this box is PG,” she told Lovelace. “I am *not* going in most of these places.”

“Relax. They don’t want you either.”

“Where are we going?”

Lovelace didn’t answer for quite some time. She simply kept walking, peeping at each screen-portal as they passed, occasionally stopping for a sniff at one, but generally just window shopping.

“Maybe we should go back the way we came,” Heleth said after a while. “Mexico was nice.”

Finally, Lovelace paused, then turned and sat staring at Heleth. “I think I have a pattern.”

“We call it tortoiseshell.”

If Lovelace could have face-palmed, she would have. “To the portals, human. The portals and the box.”

“I need more coffee,” Heleth told the cat. “All of this requires way more mental capacity than the half a cup I ingested before, well, you know.”

Lovelace’s tail swished her irritation. “Do you want to hear this or not?”

“Go on then.”

“The box has a fluctuating other-side field.”

“The box is a door?”

“Sometimes.”

“Well how does that help us?”

“It means it’s no longer a binary communication.”

Heleth knew that as soon as her face expressed confusion, the cat would offer a scathing remark or at least an eyeroll. She didn’t seem able to control the muscles, however; probably another side effect of insufficient caffeine reserves.

“Soooo,” Heleth ventured, “if it’s not binary, is it… tri? Nary?”

Side-eye is nothing unless it comes with a disdainful flick of an ear. Heleth got some side-eye.

“Anyway,” Lovelace said, “like I said, it fluctuates. But there’s a pattern to it. Most of the time, no other-side. But about one in every 323 portals here sparks it up.”

“323, huh? That seems specific.”

“I’m capable of counting.”

“Yes, of course you are.” Heleth stopped herself before she apologized to the tortie.

“This gives us an extra variable. Either it wants us to go to one of these portals, or it wants us to stay away – and no, we’re not going to revisit the ‘can a box want things’ conversation.”

“Gotcha.” Heleth hefted the box and pointed it around at the several dozen portals in their vicinity. “Which one of these lights it up? We’ll go there and see if it opens.”

Lovelace didn’t move.

“Well?”

“I have conditions.”

“You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“Do I look like a comedian?”

“You look like a cat!” Heleth was nearly shouting. “I used to think you were cute, but it turns out you’re really mean.”

26 Sept 2020
On the struggle bus today. Really bad cramps, all the painkillers on board. Rough week emotion-wise, between former student death, homelessness, and current student stresses and grief. So I fell back to binging Schitt&#39;s Creek. It&#39;s been nice. Hopefully tomorrow I will feel better enough to do some fence work. R: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
Lovelace cocked her head. “That is accurate. I am both cute and mean.”

Heleth half-screamed in frustration.

“My conditions,” Lovelace said, “are that I get half of all meat you eat from now on. None of this scrap cast-off garbage you’ve been tossing off so far. And when I want to nap, I want to nap. You should be prepared to carry me in a matter befitting my dignity and my warmth needs.”

“What else?” Heleth said. “Should I carry a portable bag of litter for you to poop in whenever you want?”

“Ew, Heleth. You know it’s utterly disgusting that you humans defecate in your own homes. Worse that you force cats to do so as well. I will relieve myself in appropriate locations as I need to, and you will have no control over that.”

“Is that a condition?”

“It is now.”

“Fine. Halfsies on meat, snuggles on demand, and fecal freedom.” Heleth held her hand out for a shake. “Though it’s not like these aren’t services you already demanded.”

“Except now it’s a contract.” Lovelace sniffed at Heleth’s hand but didn’t raise a paw to meet it. “Fine.”

The cat twirled on the spot and trotted off, turning a few times through the maze of screen-portals until she reached one that, apparently, inspired other-sidedness in the box. She looked back once to ensure Heleth was with her, then hopped right through the portal.

Heleth barely had time to register what site they were entering. She caught a (backwards) sight of a few words: CIA. Pizza. Truth. Clinton.

“Oh, shit,” Heleth said as she stepped through. Unlike everywhere else she’d popped through to so far, this was a Netscape she was utterly unfamiliar with. This would not be a trip down memory lane, obviously; but at least she wouldn’t experience any more personal traumas in this particular sojourn.

28 Sept 2020
Gave myself quite the migraine yesterday, and then passed out on the sofa before I could do the 300 words. Or call my parents, or anything. Perfect storm of chewy pizza Fri night (that tired out my jaw), no coffee, cramps, and working on fence in sun = massive migraine. It&#39;s still here, but I couldn&#39;t lose another day. R: finished Sundown Towns, started The Old Drift. W: finished Schitt&#39;s Creek, watched an ep of The Boys. L: 0.
[continue]
Heleth immediately felt a mild nausea on stepping through the screen-portal. There was a scent on the air, and she took a moment to appreciate that, in the real world, the internet had no scratch and sniff function. It was a bit like that trip to the abattoir they’d taken as part of a first year course on ecology – the instructor had been vegan, and somewhat overzealous. The memory of coppery blood and offal surged through her like the first heave of an upchucking session.

There was nothing here to indicate a source of this nauseating odor, at least as far as Heleth could see. It was dim, maybe a basement, and as she moved to follow Lovelace she found the floor equal parts squishy and sticky. Like walking on a tongue.

“Lovelace?” Heleth whispered. “I’m not digging the vibe here.”

“Fair,” came the reply. “Smells nice, though.”

Heleth followed the voice to a doorway, and into a small, close room. A circle of mismatched chairs, including folding chairs of all varieties from IKEA-cheerful to dead-guy’s-lawn, filled the space. As she watched, men, overwhelmingly white but of a variety of ages and sports affiliations, flickered into the chairs. 

They didn’t enter the room and select seats. One by one, and then more frequently, they simply flickered into existence, already sitting on one of the chairs. They were talking about something, and as the discussion grew more involved, the chairs filled; the more talkative souls seemed to stay fixed, but others flicked in and out, trading seats, as they had something more or less to say. The overlap between an in-person therapy session and an online vidconference call, shifting focus to participants as they spoke, made Heleth’s eyes cross. 

“What the hell?” Heleth said.

Lovelace sat at her feet, her attention arrested by the shifting presences in the chairs.

See yesterday&#39;s note - migraine hangover.
[continue]
The conversation in the room was difficult to parse – the men overlapped one another, shouted, threw GIFs at each other, and laughed a great deal. The laughter should have made Heleth feel lighter, but this was not sports-fans-watching-the-championship laughter, or commiseration after work laughter, or even a bit of questionably-spirited bantering laughter. The tone was harsh, threatening. Mean. 

As Heleth’s brain began to parse the different voices and different threads to the conversation, she picked up a few passages:

“…goddamn cucks won’t even know what hit them…”

“…that bitch selling off kids like campaign T-shirts…”

“…pizza. How sick is it that they’re using a pizza place…?”

“…know any other franchises that are just fronts for the libtards? We could…”

Heleth stepped back into the hallway, out of hearing range. “Oh, hellz no. We have to get out of here, Lovey.”

Lovelace padded out after her. “I wouldn’t let any one of those people pet me. They have a ‘set the cat on fire’ vibe.”

“You are correct. This is a *bad* place.” Heleth shuddered. “Why the hell did we come here?”

The tortie’s ears twitched as she continued to monitor the diatribes in the room behind her. “The box. Check the box.”

Having utterly forgotten about the box, Heleth jumped a little as she recalled it in her hand. “Oh, yeah.” She tilted it to catch the meager hallway light and mashed the button on its lid.

“Valid location,” the LCD read. “Invalid address. 98 attempts remaining.”

Heleth read the message to Lovelace before muttering a string of curse words. “Stupid box. What’s the difference between location and address?”

“Excellent,” Lovelace said. “More variables.”

“This is ridiculous. We don’t even know what’s inside the dang thing.”

“You have no sense of adventure. How are we even friends?”

Heleth shrugged. “It’s nice that you consider us–”

“What the hell is this bitch doing here?”

Lovelace reacted first, scampering down the hallway with a hiss. Heleth was barely able to react at all. Her gut seized up, her voicebox froze, and within one step backward found herself blockaded by a wall.

I actually completed a full draft of my IDN for health &amp; scicomm book today. Still not ready to submit, but hopefully by the end of tomorrow it will be in good shape. Feeling much better now that the migraine hangover is gone. Moved the horses to winter fields today. Fences in good shape, fields in good shape, horses in good shape. Things are positive (she says cautiously, knocking on wood).

The man who leered at her from the doorway was not what she expected, given the vehemence of his words. She’d expected big, hulking, so much testosterone that his head was hairless but his body a forest of shag. She’d expected a threat, a physicality that would make clear she was one thing to him and one thing only: a victim.

What she saw instead was a boy barely able to grow facial hair, his fitted baseball cap turned backward, his jeans and sneakers and T-shirt falling far short of aggressively masculine. He was shorter than she, and just as doughy; if it weren’t for the bilious twist to his face, she would have thought him adorkable, a post-adolescent Pilsbury Doughboy.

“How’d you get in here, cunt?”

Heleth’s lungs pseudo-collapsed at the forbidden insult. Only… the words were harsh, but the voice was shaking. She made her eyes travel back up from the floor to his face. His gaze flicked back and forth, not meeting her own. His adam’s apple bobbed, and he clearly didn’t know what to do with his hands.

She took a deep breath in her completely not collapsed lungs, channeled Lovelace, and said, “I walked in. What’s your problem?”

Fear and anger battled for their right to respond as she stepped away from the wall. This wasn’t a Stanley Kowalski, brimming with passion and entitlement in equal measure, sure of his control. This was a Wizard of Oz, great and terrible from behind a curtain of keystrokes and anonymity – mewling and pathetic once his guise was stripped away.

She swallowed her fear and stepped into the incel’s personal space, likely the first woman to do so voluntarily. She didn’t say a word. She stared at him, fixed on the pimple humping up between his eyes. She could smell pungent body spray, acne medication, and something sweet, like pancake syrup dried and sticky on a formica tabletop.

He made one sad attempt to puff his chest and stand his ground, wavered a “whatever”, and retreated back to the circle of chairs.

I managed to get the interdisciplinarity/interactive narrative scicomm book in by 12:30am this morning. Tired now. But got this done and just need to work through Spanish and I can go to bed.

Heleth caught her breath, not quite sure when she’d last been able to inhale. She backed slowly away from the doorway, attempting to retreat without appearing to retreat. Once out of sight of the maddened incels, she scurried down the hallway and around a corner, psp-psp-psping for Lovelace.

“C’mon, Lovey, I want to get out of here.”

She felt a soft warm bump to the back of her leg. She turned, finding Lovelace inexplicably behind her. “How do you do that?”

The kitty mrowled and spun in a circle, then trotted away. Responding to years of training, Heleth obediently followed.

Within a few steps, Lovelace darted toward a garbage chute set low to the floor, and disappeared.

“Son of a…” Heleth peered both ways down the hallway. She visually measured the chute, comparing to her hips. Unlike her slim feline, once her head fit into a gap the rest of her body was *not* sure to follow. She reached to the opening, hoping it would be larger up close than it appeared.

TARDIS-like, it was much bigger on the inside; as soon as her fingers entered the opening, it tugged her through to the comforting darkness of the backside of the internet.

“Holy crap,” she told Lovelace once she’d assured herself she was through. “We do *not* want to go to places like that, Lovey. That’s a group that would set you on fire and make me watch.”

“Humans are disgusting creatures,” Lovelace said.

“Please tell me the rest of the box-other-side locations aren’t that scary.” Heleth contemplated. “We really need a better term. ‘Other-sidedness’ is so awkward.”

“I make no guarantees.”

“Are we sure we want to keep following this box?”

“I have no preference.”

Heleth sighed. “Fine. What’s the next one?”

The next one was a children’s game site. Heleth had nearly surrendered her sanity before Lovelace led her out again.

September is gone, fall is here, and here we go! Tired today because was up late to submit book, and then up early for some unknown reason. But almost done for today. R: The Trees, The Old Drift. W: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
They’d visited and rescued themselves from another dozen dizzying or dangerous sites before Heleth plunked the box down on the ground. Her toes itched to kick it into the darkness where it could never be recovered.

“This is useless. The dang thing isn’t leading us anywhere. It’s just random sites of madness.”

“That last one had a certain charm.”

“It was just a button that you push and then nothing happens!”

“You can’t tell me there’s not a certain satisfaction to be had from simply pushing a button.”

“With our luck every time we pushed that button someone on the other side of the world was executed.”

“Even better.”

“Psychopath.”

“Human.”

Frustrated, Heleth mashed the box’s button several times in a row, as though waiting for an elevator that refused to turn up. To her surprise, the LCD actually changed its message.

“Need a hint? It’s always in the last place you look.” The display flashed once, twice, then told her, “86 attempts remaining.”

“How is that a hint?” Heleth shouted at the box. “*Everything* is always in the last place you look! Why would you keep looking once you find the thing?”
[note]
There’s a journey here that I want to explore. I want Heleth to have to go to places that make her uncomfortable. That make her learn things. That make her face up to the world. She’s hidden away from it for a long time. In edits, I think the incel scene will be later, and she won’t so easily face him down.

So what will make her uncomfortable? Her own privilege. Selfishness. Blindness to other people’s experiences. The people she’s hurt with it. Make her a little bit Ebenezer Scrooge, a little bit Sydney Bristow – she has to disguise herself and play different roles to get through these sites to find what she’s looking for. In each disguise, she learns a little bit more about the world and her place within it.
[continue]

“You take it too literally,” Lovelace said, eyes narrow. “It’s more that it’s the last place you look in your mind – the memory furthest from the top, the location most unexpected.”

“Why doesn’t it just say that?”

“It’s only a small display.”

Heleth grumbled, but conceded the point. “Fine, where is the last place I would look?”

“What do you avoid on the internet at all costs?”

She considered. There was a lot on the internet to avoid. Google searches that included the word “kitten”. Chain emails. Anything that asked her to take a survey for a free tablet. Anonymous forums. 

“Do I have to?”

“I’m not your mother.”

Heleth sighed, then told the cat where they should visit next.

Not much going on today. Had a long talk with Pan, who is still struggling quite a bit. Watched The Boys in the Band with Amy, which was great. Otherwise, just watching Cougar Town. R: The Old Drift, The Trees. L: 0.
[continue]
It was a place she had never wanted to go. She loved being online, enjoyed surfing the ‘net, as they’d used to say in the day. She’d had a LiveJournal along with everyone else, and remembered actually buying used items at auction on eBay.

She stepped through the portal behind Lovelace, the back door to Azeroth. The tortie was instantly transformed into a battlecat that He-Man would have been proud to ride into battle with, complete with saber teeth and a barbed tail. She peered back at her new accoutrements, hissed once, and lashed her tail.

“This place is great. Why didn’t we come here before?”

Heleth held her arms up. “Come on! I couldn’t have gotten elf or at least remain human? I have to be a freaking goblin?” Her toes were gnarled and her skin had a bilious hue. “I *hate* this place.”

An orc trotted by. “A/S/L?” he texted, because of course it was a he, and probably over 60, because who pulled out AOL messenger hit-up lines anymore? Heleth turned her back and leaned over the box, struggling to keep a grip on it with her gobliny fingers. She had to get Lovelace to mash the button with a claw, because her grotesque digits were too big to manage it.

“Don’t go alone” was all the box told her.

“Well, at least that’s something new.” Heleth sighed. “I’m not alone. I have you.”

Lovelace blinked slowly enough that it was definitely judgement rather than a biological need to blink. “I’m fairly certain it doesn’t mean me.”

“Dammit.” With supreme reluctance, Heleth spun for a minute, the landscape twisting around her, then headed in the direction of the nearest visible building. If she was going to have to team up with someone on a quest, it was at least not going to be AOL guy.

She found a wandering blood elf – well, it was more that the blood elf saw Lovelace in all her armored splendor and just about accosted them.

“What race is it? I’ve never seen that before! It’s amazing.”

“Uh,” Heleth said, hurriedly trying to read the speech bubbles popping up next to the elf’s head. Being *in* a game where everyone else was remotely piloting an avatar was awkward. “She modded it.” She’d seen some tweets about modding. That was a thing, right?

“Whoa. I didn’t think you could mod like that here.”

Lovelace sat, lashing her barbed tail. “Tick tock,” she told Heleth.

“No, this is World of Warcraft,” Heleth returned. “Get with it.” The tail tip whipped out a bit farther, the barb slicing at Heleth’s ankle.

“Fucking ow!” Heleth grabbed her ankle, green goop seeping out of it.

The blood elf walked away. No goodbye, no explanation, just gone.

“That was rude,” Heleth said. “Hey! Come back.” But shouts meant nothing in World of Warcraft, and proximity meant everything. Heleth stood there, her leg bleeding, her goblin chest heaving. “I hate it here.”

“You don’t say.” Lovelace licked the end of her tail, ostensibly cleaning it. Heleth thought she was enjoying the session far too much.

“I don’t like fighting. I don’t like talking to strangers. Why do people think this game is fun?”

“Quests. Adventures. Killing with no consequence. Puzzles. The fantasy of having some level of self-efficacy. I would think this is like heaven for you. Also, everyone else here seems as equally inadequate as you are.”

“You know, in the end, it turns out I don’t like you very much.”

Lovelace flicked an ear. “Our relationship doesn’t have anything to do with like. We’re family.”

Heleth looked down at the box again. “Even the box doesn’t think we’re together. It told me not to go alone even though you’re already here.”

Finished reading The Trees today - it was pretty good. Also finished removing the skirting boards in the downstairs hallways, and got to use the angle grinder on the nails left protruding from the walls. That was fun. Fairly quiet day.

[continue]
Lovelace yawned. She didn’t even try to make it not look fake. She padded onward, ignoring Heleth’s huff of indignation.

They wandered into the nearest tavern. Outside, not much had been going on – an orc who seemed a bit lost, a dwarf who shouted racist invectives at everyone in ear shot, a human who was trying to get the dwarf to calm down. Heleth was glad to step into the tavern, assuming it would be mostly empty, with maybe a non-player character innkeeper who could help direct them.

Of course, nothing ever goes as Heleth would prefer, so she stepped into the gloom and smoke of a completely packed tavern. Trolls, elves, dwarves, mages, warriors – everything this wannabe Tolkien cyberspace could throw in, it did. Lovelace strolled through the tavern and curled up next to the raging fire, a gnome obligingly scooting out of her way.

Heleth stood in the doorway. She would have been utterly frozen save for the animated-GIF-like repetitive movement the game programmed in for stationary characters. Her body sort of bobbed there, useless and faux-lifeless, as she stared back at the dozens of eyes turned her way.

And then she noped out of there.

Despite the still raving dwarf outside, she retreated to the street, finding an alley and sticking her morphed goblin body inside it. She had no idea what internal goblin anatomy was like, but it clearly had a functioning heart and lungs, because hers were both rabbiting as though she’d just finished a 400-meter sprint, not walked a few feet. Her chest felt compressed, and she fumbled to see if she was wearing restrictive armor, but she found only leather and fabric. Her throat burned, her eyes welled up, and hot tears streamed down her cheeks. She couldn’t fill her lungs; she was drowning on dry land.

Laura&#39;s birthday today, so just remembered to send her a gift card. I&#39;m a terrible daughter, but ugh. I&#39;m tired of both getting and giving. Anyway...

She fought valiantly to remember the anxiety attack tips that went around Twitter every so often. Shallow breaths into a bag? No, that was for hyperventilating. But wait, wasn’t she hyperventilating? How was hyperventilation even possible – how could someone *breathe* too much? She moved on from confused breathing tips to the mental ones. Meditation. That was supposed to be really good for anxiety. She’d never really gotten around to it, though. Why hadn’t she gotten around to it? Too many shows on Netflix, that was why. Who wanted to sit around in silence when two-dimensional friends were just a click away? Could she meditate now? Shit, no. Meditation started with breathing, and her lungs were clearly on a schedule of their own at the minute.

Focus. On a thing. OH! Look around and find things corresponding to each sense. Okay, then. She looked across the alley, and saw an artificially smooth stone wall. All right, that was a thing. It wasn’t real, but she could see it, so that was a thing. Um, ears. What could she hear? A wheeze as she fought to inhale. That wasn’t good, was it? Wheezing was an asthma thing. She’d never had asthma, as far as she knew. Could asthma spontaneously erupt? Were her bronchioles even now inflaming and swelling and shutting down? Did goblins get asthma? Could she die in here? Her character could definitely die, but what happened to her, to Heleth, if her goblin body died? Were they one and the same?

Focus. Again. The wall. It was pixels, nothing but 1s and 0s, but she could see it. Could she feel it? She reached for it, saw her knobbly green hand set against its surface, but nothing. She couldn’t feel stone, couldn’t feel its weathered roughness or the divots of a quarryperson’s chisel. Just the sensation of her hand stopping as it encountered an object coded to be solid.

Got Wonderbox up for beta-testing yesterday. Feels like a major milestone, but it&#39;s likely it will simply trickle on a bit. 

Set the car on fire today. Well, nothing so dramatic. Paul woke up at 6am remembering that he was taking my jeep in for MOT, but I needed to unhook my horse trailer from it. Out I trudged in my PJs and wellies and raincoat, but of course the battery was dead from me never going anywhere. 6am me should NEVER do ANYTHING, because of course I hooked the battery cables up in reverse, burned them up and they caught fire. I&#39;m in the pouring rain trying not to get electrified/burned. In the end the battery was too dead to save anyway. I cried and Paul gave me his toast.

Gave my first research talk today, on interdisciplinary research. Went really well!

She fought off the dizziness and the dissonance. She could feel her body, and her body could feel her. It was there, she could see it. She could hear her breath. Maybe it was the stone. The wall had no texture, so she couldn’t feel it. It was coded to be a barricade, not to provide sensation. That was it. That had to be it. She would insist that be it.

She could see and hear, but find nothing to feel. What were the other senses? Smell, taste, hot, cold, pressure, pain, and another one. She knew there were more than five, any dummy had to know there were more than five, but it was like the seven dwarves. Who could name them all? And anyway, inside this badly drawn construct, she couldn’t smell or taste anything. She doubted she could feel hot or cold if she couldn’t feel pressure and texture. Pain was something she didn’t particularly want to test. And the other one. She’d never been good at vocabulary words. 

Lovelace would have known. Where the hell was Lovelace? That sure would have helped. Cats were calming. Their purrs were just the right frequency to speed healing. Purrs were the most magical sound in the world. If she could just hold Lovelace, if she could press her face into that soft fur, breathe in that clean scent, feel that gentle vibration pressed against her, then everything would be all right.

But the tortie wasn’t there. The tortie was inside by a warm fire, sleeping circular, and psychopathically not caring a fig what happened to Heleth outside.

Her breath tore, going raggedy in her chest. She was going to pass out. Or vomit. Or both. Then suffocate in her own sick. Could goblins vomit, or were they like horses, without any regurgitation reflex? How did she even know that?

She closed her eyes, and her mind suddenly gave her an image to hold on to. Black and white line drawing, a chonk kitty sprawling through four lines of verse:

*Love to eat them meeces \
Meeces what I love to eat \
Bite they tiny heads off \
Nibble on they tiny feet*

Her coffee mug. Coffee. Kitties. Warmth and that heady scent, like spiced earth and hearth fires. Sipping as she settled into her sofa, Lovelace in her lap, a teen romance twinkling on her screen.

Her breathing slowed.

Got Jeep all fixed up today. Got bits and bobs of to-do list done, so now can focus on other, bigger things. Bangor business cases for the third round of redundancies came out today. Paul all good, Eben and Steff good. Steff moving to Business School. A/V moving to History, NA getting ousted. I couldn&#39;t be happier unless Trump and Johnson both got wiped out in freak napalming incidents.

Gradually, the tears dried up, and she was left with the shakes. Panic attack hangover. She knew if she’d had her real body, she’d be clammy, her mouth cottony, her bowels clenched. She felt a moment of gratitude for the poor virtual experience of inhabiting an avatar in a world where human consciousness was never meant to enter. She could feel her feels, but she couldn’t feel their embodiment.

Heleth looked down at the box, still in her hand. What was it? Who made it? Why in the name of all that is holy was she following it on some mad quest around the internet?

“What am I *doing*?” she asked it. 

It didn’t answer, and she wasn’t keen to press the button just to have it gleefully strike off another attempt at opening it. 

She took a deep breath, the first one she was able to suck all the way into the bottom of her lungs, and leaned her head back against the tavern wall. She stared up at the even expanse of perfectly distributed blue sky, and considered the absurdity of her current situation.

She hadn’t left her own home for months, even before the virus and its lockdown waves. It was easy, these days. You get a telecommuting job, pick up some freelance gigs, and you could earn enough to keep the lights on and the streaming content coming. She’d embraced it. She’d told herself it was, at the very least, environmentally sound. No more commute. No more wasted time in meetings where men talked just to make sure everyone was paying attention to them. No more tuna in the staff microwave.

She didn’t live in isolation. She was in a terraced flat, and she had neighbors. She heard kids come home from school, go outside to play, get called in to dinner. She heard marital spats and singing in the shower and curses from hammered thumbs. But all of it was safely on the other side of a wall, window, and door.

Did a virtual research day with folks in the department today, which was nice. Got a 3-year plan rolling, some research on virtual crucible, and my outline for the Bloomsbury book started. Fairly chill day.

The process of self-isolation had never been intentional. She’d had friends. She’d gone to uni, had flatmates. She had never really gotten along with alcohol, and noise plus crowds had always made her uncomfortable at least, though in recent years it seemed to be getting worse. So pubs and clubs were on her list of “I’d rather not”. But obviously she’d gotten married. She must have been social enough at some point to meet, date, marry, and divorce Miguel.

Perhaps that had been the start, really. Being with Miguel, at the time, meant she wouldn’t die alone. He filled her need for human companionship, and even if she hadn’t really meant to, she’d let what few friendships she’d had just fade away. And anyway, there’d been those few years when she discovered, time after time, that friends weren’t always what they were made out to be on TV. Most people were selfish, narcissistic assholes. They wanted something from you, or they wanted your attention, but they didn’t really want *you*.

Her 20s had been a series of betrayals. Susana, the college roommate who slept with the guy she’d been dating. Breanna, the friend who’d seemed so bright and charming and warm until she entered into stalker territory, driving by Heleth’s house on the regular and almost never leaving when she visited. Djani, who had had the audacity to insist that Heleth could not understand Djani’s perspective as an immigrant, when Heleth definitely had experience traveling and being a minority in some places. Sarah, who called and cried at her over the most insignificant of things, yet “couldn’t take the stress” if Heleth did the same.

So by the time she and Miguel finally fell apart, there had been no one on speed dial she would have trusted with her heartbreak, even if she needed it.

Only… she hadn’t needed it. She hadn’t fallen into the pit of despair. She’d prided herself on that, on not falling apart on a personal level as her marriage had proved a failure only three years in. Trying to remember that period, though, all she could dredge up in her memory was gray. Just a gray blob of days and jobs and chores.

First meeting for the ELC4 today. Went well, sounds good. Also meeting about doing the guest editing for the Frontiers journal with An N. That could be interesting. It was very much the man thing of tell me everything I already knew, try to one-up it, and then tell me the things I&#39;d fixed. Oh well. I&#39;ll gain autonomy quickly and not have to deal.

Heleth considered her current situation. She was embodied by a goblin avatar in a multi-player game. She had no idea if that constituted a reality anywhere other than her own injured brain. In all likelihood, she was unconscious on her living room floor, crumpled in a heap. Best case scenario, someone had found her and called an ambulance, and she was even now washed and combed and quietly adventuring through a coma in the hospital. Worst case, she was slowly dying there with no one missing her, and at some point Lovelace (the real Lovelace) was going to run out of cat food and start munching on her exposed face. The real one, not the goblin one.

Every TV episode she’d ever watched where a character was on the brink of death, or lost in a coma, trying to find their way back from the light at the end of the tunnel, had them go on some strange mythical journey to learn about themselves. To reconnect with themselves, and their loved ones. It was always some re-envisioning of A Christmas Carol, or more recently, *Groundhog Day*. This had to be something like that. The box was a construction of her subconscious, trying to lead her down some path or the other. Unfortunately, it was coming off more like a random dream than a spirit quest.

She stared down at the box. “What bullshit are you going for?” she asked it. “Are you the ghost of Heleth past, present, or future?” She turned it around and around, trying to figure out exactly what it wanted, her subconscious, so that she could just go there and do it and wake up from this absurd trip into her own mind.

The possibility that she was not in a coma trope, and that she and Lovelace had actually entered the existential spaces between internet localities, never occurred to Heleth.

Lazy day today. Got up, breakfast, read a bit of Battleground (Dresden), fell asleep for a nap, woke up, finished it. Really good. I&#39;m sad that Murphy died, but also... I knew he didn&#39;t have anywhere to go with their relationship. Dresden&#39;s world never gets any less dangerous, and she was just about crippled by this point, mentally and physically. Even if they did settle down for a while, she&#39;d grow old and die and he&#39;d just keep ticking on. It was pretty doomed. I don&#39;t love that Butcher keeps fridging Dresden&#39;s girlfriends, but I&#39;m also not surprised. 

Started reading The Cipher. Watched a documentary about triplets separated at birth, who turned out to have been separated purposely for a twin study, which is pretty shit. But that&#39;s about it!
[continue]
Thus it was that Heleth chose to believe the more Scully-like of the two explanations: she was in a coma and/or dying, and these were either the adventures she would have before waking, or the last gasps of life before dying. Either way, there was no real structure to them, and no real consequence.

She stood and, moving with that uncanny chimera of a walk between Armstrong’s moonwalk and Michael Jackson’s, burst back into the tavern.

All movement and conversation ceased, as the many revelers turned to her. Lovelace was still curled up by the fire, but now she had a couple of acolytes devotedly stroking her fur. She opened only one eye at Heleth’s overdramatic entrance, rolled it, and resumed melting into the hearth.

Heleth pushed the box high up in the air, shouting, “Who wants to go on a quest?”

A resounding cry went up (some in voice audio, some in speech bubbles), and a posse – or perhaps in this genre it was better called a horde – of a dozen or so followed her outside. They crowded around her, waiting to be filled in.

“Uh,” Heleth started. “So I have this box–”

“Yeah, where’s that from, dude?” a nearby mage asked. “I’m, like, eighty levels above you and I’ve never seen anything like it.”

The horde pressed closer, trying to get a look at the novel inventory item.

Heleth tucked the box against her side. “It’s not, uh, from here.”

“It’s a mod?” asked a girl-voiced orc to her left. “Mods can’t send us on quests.”

“Well I don’t have a particular quest,” Heleth began. “I just know I need to go on one.” She felt her momentum begin to peter out.

The horde grumbled, peppered with frowny-face emojis from the speech bubbles. They drifted off, one by one, waving dismissively.

“Hold just a moment.” Lovelace padded out from the tavern, her fur steaming in the bright outdoor light. The two horde-members who remained – a level 34 troll and a level 55 blood elf – paused. “I believe I have an adventure that would suit you,” Lovelace said.

The cat, now a battle-cat, hadn’t just been lazing by the fire, it turned out. She’d been listening, picking up bits and pieces from anyone in hearing distance. And for a cat, hearing distance was a pretty decent area.

She outlined a collection quest, a bit of a scavenger hunt, and Heleth was relieved it didn’t seem to involve a lot of maiming or killing. One of her new friends seemed somewhat disappointed, and indeed, once they got started the blood elf was easily distracted by new solo quests that involved fights of one kind or another.

Heleth sighed and looked at the troll as they waited for the elf to rejoin them. “I’m Heleth, by the way.”

“Oh. Hi. Um.” The troll had a mic, so Heleth could hear their social awkwardness in real time. “I’m Garglesh. Well, I mean, my avatar is Garglesh. I’m not. I mean, who would name their kid that, right? Monsters. Not my parents. My parents aren’t monsters. They’re just fine. They’re dentists. They named me Jamie.”

“Nice to meet you, Jamie.” Heleth couldn’t tell from the voice if Jamie was male or female, and she decided it didn’t matter. A troll was a troll was a troll.

“You play WoW a lot?” Jamie asked.

“Never,” Heleth said.

“Oh.”

They fell into silence, Garglesh cycling through their avatar’s idle motions, Heleth feeling herself fidgeting, which seemed to come out as a quarter-turn one way then the next, over and over.

“Hey, do we really need this guy, Lovelace?” Heleth asked. “Can me and Ja–Garglesh here just go on without him?”

“I don’t make the rules,” Lovelace replied. “Do what you want.”

“I say we go. Yeah?”

“Okay,” Jamie agreed, and they became an awkward team of three.

As they pointed their avatars to the next collection point, Heleth ran their timid conversation through her head and it occurred to her she might have been an asshole.

Have had a DAY. Took Jake for flu shot, got there, realized I&#39;d forgotten his passport. He got the jab, I took him home, got the passport, went back. Jeep tires were low, so on the way back I went to the Texaco in Llangefni to air them up. Only one had a broken valve, so trying to air it up let all the air out of it. No jack in the jeep because Meirion had used it to repair the shed, and I forgot to put it back in. Called RAC – took them THREE FREAKING HOURS. I was not happy. Finally got home, and Newt had eaten a big Dairy Milk bar - some vomiting, and then he got some activated charcoal and seems to feel a bit better. 

Just DRAMA. But at least everyone&#39;s okay now.

After they’d successfully completed the first leg, Heleth turned to Garglesh. “Sorry about… before. I guess I was kinda harsh on WoW, huh?”

“You sounded a little like I’d asked you if you acted in porn.”

“Damn.” They paused to read a scroll with additional instructions. Oh, good, a physical challenge. “I’m not really great with either violence or strangers. You put them together, and it’s my worst nightmare.”

Garglesh measured the distance they had to jump, took a leap, and landed neatly on the small platform topping the first pilon. Dozens of pilons extended out into the digital lake; their task was to jump from one to the next until they arrived on the small island in the distance. The troll established their balance and looked back at Heleth. “Makes sense. I like people. I’m just really bad at talking to them. I get all my ideas mixed up and I start tripping over my words. Sometimes I actually trip. I’m better in game, you know. I can control an avatar no problem, so I can level up. This is my third character. It’s easier to meet people, too. I mean, I don’t have to read body language or worry about seeing them in real life.”

Garglesh hopped to the next pilon, and Heleth sized up her first jump. She took a running start, leapt, and landed squarely on the platform. And then her momentum carried her to the other side, and she dropped off into the lake.

“Well, shit,” she said, looking up at Garglesh, now on the third pilon.

“You’ll get it,” the troll encouraged her. “Just walk back out and try again.”

Lovelace, who had been patiently watching the two avatars awkwardly jump on the pilons, stretched, then bounded quickly over a dozen platforms. She paused midway to the island and began to give herself a bath.

“Show off,” Heleth muttered.

Much more boring day today, thank goodness. Induction event this morning, meeting with mentor on the science side, little research seminar. Admin type stuff. Sleepy, though. I&#39;m not good at getting up when it&#39;s still morning anymore. Want to go to bed now, and it&#39;s only 10pm.

She only ended up in the drink five more times before she figured out a consistent strategy. Slowly, she caught up to Garglesh.

“Hey,” the troll said. “Told you you’d get it.”

Heleth puffed. Garglesh was a digital avatar controlled by a seated and resting Jamie somewhere out in the actual world; Heleth was physically having to do this. She tried to cover her heavy breathing with silence, but somehow that made it even more obvious. She ignored Garglesh’s hesitant “Are you, like, okay?” and counted the pilons left to the island. Six more.

When they arrived at the island, more or less together, Lovelace was sitting pointedly by the crystal they’d come to collect. “Next task should perhaps be somewhat less physical,” she commented, eyeing Heleth.

“Laugh it up, fuzzball,” Heleth replied. She examined the crystal – it could only be released by two players accessing it together. “You didn’t wait for us on purpose. You just couldn’t get it by yourself.”

Lovelace yawned and padded away.

Garglesh leaned over. “Is the cat actually on our team? Because it feels like she’s not really, um, on our team.”

“Tell me about it. Do you have cats?”

“Allergic.”

“Welp, that’s both a blessing and a curse. I love cats, but they’re like commitment-phobic white guys in romantic comedies. Really into themselves, super cute, and eventually they *might* fall in love with you, but mostly you have to spend your whole time lavishing them with attention and worship for them to even acknowledge your existence.”

“Whoa,” the troll said, laughing. “That’s, like, a lot. Little Lannisters all over the place, huh?”

“With built-in teeth and claws.”

They grinned at each other for a moment, and Heleth decided she liked the troll. For now.

“You gave me the awl from the firepit,” Garglesh said. They lined themself up to reach for the object. “Seems like the crystal should be yours. Or not. You don’t have to. Or, well, that seems like I’m trying to, you know, pull a fast one or something, and convince you to give it to me even though it’s not my turn and–”

Heleth waved an arm. “Chill. I’m cool with it. Ready?”

They reached out, grabbed the crystal, and released it from its plinth.

Good day today. Couple of useless meetings, but meeting with line manager went well. Then I spent the afternoon puzzling out a software flow for her, which pleased me no end when I was able to make it work beautifully (using MS PowerFlow to take data from a MS Form, put it into a Word doc, and email it to both line manager and staff member). Considering I didn&#39;t even know MS PowerFlow existed until today, I&#39;m rather pleased with myself.

Garglesh bowed and relinquished the crystal to Heleth. It instantly vanished into Heleth’s box.

“That’s a weird item,” Garglesh said. “I’ve never seen one. Where’d you pick it up?”

“I, uh, I…” Heleth glanced at Lovelace, who merely raised an eyebrow. “I won it at this auction thingy.”

“Huh. Cool.” The troll’s gaze lingered on the item, puzzled, but they didn’t push it. “Listen, I’ve been on for, like, hours now, and I gotta pee and prolly eat some food that’s not mostly salt, and I think sleep? Oh, hell, yeah I just looked at the clock, and shit I’m going to need *all* the caffeine at work tomorrow. Sorry to just dump you here, but, I mean, is that, like, okay?”

Heleth laughed to cover the sob she felt welling up. In the real world, Jamie was going to have some toast and crawl into bed, while she was probably rotting away on her living room carpet. “No problem,” she said. “Go tend to the living.”

Garglesh gave her an odd glance at that. “I’ll ping you when I’m on next, if you still want to hang out. Or, not like, hang out, but do stuff. Quest stuff. This.”

“Me too.” Heleth watched as the troll went from vaguely lifelike to definitely in a holding pattern. The avatar would just hang there till its director returned.

Heleth turned to Lovelace. “Do you think we’re done here? I miss having human hands.”

“The lake has some other-sidedness to it. We can leave if we want.” The cat sniffed at the box. “Perhaps you should perform a status check.”

Sighing, Heleth shook the box. To her surprise, something inside made a satisfying *thunk* as she rattled it. The crystal. Somehow.

She pressed the button, and the display practically beamed at her.

Good day today. Woke up stupid early for no reason, couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. So went for walk, had breakfast, went to my 10am meeting for Horizon 2020 Green Deal. Probably not really going forward with that one, but made some good networking contacts. Spent way too much time staring at a screen today, and my eyes went wacky. But had lunch (4ish) and went out and lunged Jake - first time since the pandemic started that I&#39;ve worked him! He looks pretty awesome. Seth Rogen show pony rather than Zac Efron eventer, but still pretty great.

“Clue unlocked! Consider: Everything Is Alive.”

Heleth read the clue to Lovelace. “How is that a clue?”

“That’s what you said last time. Yet you seem to have figured it out in the end.” Uninterested, the battlecat trotted to the isle’s edge, and straight into the digital water. Huffing, Heleth hurried after her.

She was relieved to reach the portal and shed her goblin skin. True, her loungewear was starting to get a bit whiffy, but at least her body was in familiar proportions and colors.

“Hey, I’m hungry again and I think I need to pee. How do we know how long we’ve been here?”

“I could eat,” Lovelace said, and sniffed at the bottoms of several screen-portals.

“NOT sushi,” Heleth told her, shooing her away from a screen before the cat could leap through. “Remember that time I went on that date with Dwayne from work?”

“No.”

“I spent fourteen hours vomiting.”

“No.”

“You tried to *eat* it.”

“I like fish.”

“Cats are gross.”

“Humans poop where they sleep.”

“Look, there’s the Whitby tourism site. We can get fish and chips there. Happy?”

“Moderately.” But the cat bounced through the portal easily enough.

Dracula’s British port of call was far less crowded than she remembered from her trip there in school. She’d been really into the gothicness of it all back then, with her black nail polish and a magnetic stud clipped to her nostril. She’d been disgusted to find the little seaport completely commercialized for tourist dollars from toe to widow’s peak. The only spot of contentment she’d had the whole day was that it was pouring rain, and thus the abbey was drenched in gray and gloom. And most of the numpties had ducked into shops and cafés. Someone’s Irish Hound had escaped its leash, and just as Heleth was left utterly alone crossing the ancient cemetery, the massive dog had loped past her, tongue lolling, with just a single chuff hello. It disappeared around the back of the abbey, and its owner, assuming it had one, never appeared.

Rough start to the day. I dreamed this morning that Paul told me he didn&#39;t love me anymore, that the last two years of depression had been no fun, and I was fat and boring, and he was leaving. Woke up sobbing, and he had to come snuggle to calm me down. Then I tripped on the step from the sun room, hit every doorframe and door on my way down, and belly-flopped on that cold/hard-ass tile in the hallway. I think I sprained both knees, bruised a rib, sprained a wrist, and bloodied my arm. Feck. Otherwise, played out to be a fairly good day after.

None of that mattered to her now. She was grown up and beyond such adolescent fantasies about vampires and their thinly veiled practices related to sex and desire. Now she just read cheap romance novels for vicarious thrills.

The streets weren’t exactly empty, but she’d be willing to bet the business owners in the town were freaking out about the lack of tourists. Masks on faces and signs on shops preventing entry without one told Heleth this version of Whitby, unlike Puerta Vallarta, was not constructed solely from her own memories.

“Shit,” she said to Lovelace. “How am I going to get food without a mask? Double shit. I don’t have my wallet. I didn’t think this through.”

“When have you ever?” Lovelace asked. “Just sit down and be ready to portal out.”

Confused, Heleth cast about and discovered she was standing right next to a bench overlooking the harbor. “Well, all right,” she said, and plonked herself down as Lovelace trotted off.

Not five minutes later the cat came scurrying back, the handle to a takeaway bag in her mouth, its ripe fullness dragging behind her. Heleth barely managed to spot the return portal next to the gate to the marina before Lovelace and her booty dashed through.

Half-expecting a cartoonish fishmonger in white apron and paper hat to come running by, Heleth put on her “nothing to see here” face and slowly strolled to the portal.

Once again in the safety of their darkness behind the internet, she found Lovelace already climbing through the paper-wrapped morsels. The tortie had nicked an order capable of feeding a family of five.

“Lovelace, this bag weighs three times what you do.”

“Mmph,” the cat replied. “And tastes three times as good.”

Heleth grabbed a box. “No vinegar?”

The cat narrowed her eyes, and Heleth grinned.

Saturday today. Slept in, breakfast, finished The Radium Girls, then did various bits and bobs. Found a new way to braid Jake&#39;s mane that doesn&#39;t require it to be short and even, so much less pulling is in our future. Lunged him, cleaned chicken coop, did some laundry, sugar washed the front hallway. Now for chilling with a horror movie!

The fish and chips, at least, were as good as she’d remembered. She chowed down on hers, watching in disgust as Lovelace ripped through several pieces of battered fish, picking out the fishiest bits and leaving the rest a half-masticated mess.

She realized she needed to pee, popped back into Whitby to make use of the public toilet, and then back again to find Lovelace curled on top of the remaining takeaway boxes, siphoning off their remaining heat as she purred to herself.

“C’mon, Lovey, time to go.”

The tortie did not respond.

Heleth gave her a poke, and got a brief chirrup before she snuggled deeper into herself. Remembering their deal, Heleth scooped her up as she would a soft and warm lump of rising bread dough, and slid the bundle inside her hoodie. The cat purred and napped on.

Feeling oddly lonely, Heleth wandered the higgledy-piggledy passageways of screen-portals. She saw a lot of things she wished she hadn’t, a lot of things she found utterly unfathomable, and a lot of things that were just plain dull. The sheer number of slipshod small business sites with no information and no updates in the last decade was mind-boggling. Of course, that was nothing compared to the porn, but she’d assumed there was far more of that than she’d ever have guessed, and she was right.

She found herself slowing down amidst a collection of text-heavy sites, many of which had black backgrounds with some kind of neon font and lamentable information organization. Yet once she stopped to read a few, she felt as though she were staring directly into people’s brains – and not all of those brains were entirely copacetic. These were the quiet obsessions of thousands, collected online for some mythical audience their creators must have only hoped could be out there.

Finished up with Paul&#39;s snug/office today. I think it looks nice. I&#39;m hoping that getting into it will ease his stress some, as he&#39;s very on edge. I have no idea what to do to help.

As she wandered, she contemplated the clue. Everything is alive. Three words, very simple, but she couldn’t grasp their collective meaning. In the context of the box, did that mean the box was alive? In the context of the internet, did it mean that avatars and cyberidentities were alive? In the context of Heleth, could it possibly mean that she was still alive?

She certainly hoped so. She wished Lovelace would wake up so the cat could snark some sense into her. Her mind was already drifting into the possibility that this was not any of the possibilities she had previously considered – namely, that she was either unconscious or in a coma, and trying to find her way back to health, or the more farfetched notion that she was actually *in* the internet. Instead, the box’s clue made her consider a third option: that she was already dead, and this was some kind of afterlife.

It wasn’t a concept she was comfortable with. For one thing, Lovelace’s presence was concerning. She’d never forgive herself if her own clumsiness caused the cat’s death as well. On the other hand, if she was dead and simply imagining some version of Lovelace, or the afterlife gave her a Lovelace avatar, the real Lovelace might even now be dying of thirst and hunger, trapped on the inside of the door to Heleth’s flat.

Furthermore, Heleth had for years identified herself as a member of the Flying Spaghetti Monster’s congregation. Pastafarianism, of course, marked her as a web surfer of a certain age, but it had resonated with her then, and resonated with her now. The satirical take on religion was more real to her than bible stories or millennia-old ceremonies, and it perfectly summed up her skeptical disdain for “opiates of the masses”. An afterlife would shoot all kinds of holes in her carefully crafted netizen persona.

Good day today. Got some good work done, first meeting re: research center for health/scicomm. I like my coworkers, and working with so many women, and so far it&#39;s working out brilliantly. It reminds me of all those years I spent in shitty living situations at A&amp;M, and then for the last 3 months lived with Stacie and it was HOME. It&#39;s brilliant.

Her wanderings and ponderings were beginning to tire her out, and her vision almost blurred out the website before she could read its mirrored title.

“Not a chance,” she said. “It can’t possibly be this easy.”

She couldn’t see what the site was before she traveled there – it was just those three words, black on white, stretched across the screen. She just had to hope it wasn’t a site that sold black market dragons or that catered to necrophiliacs or something.

Hitching the still slumbering Lovelace into a more comfortable position in her hoodie, Heleth stepped forward and pressed her fingertips to the Everything is Alive site.

The smell was the first thing she noticed. It was that warm, musty scent, that mix of mothballs and dust and human that permeated every secondhand shop on Earth. The light was dim, but it was still brighter than the back side of the internet, and she had to wait for her irises to narrow. When the pain in her eyes subsided, she discovered she was not in a tight, packed shop as she’d expected. Rather, she stood in the middle of a warehouse. The light was dim because the ceiling was so far above her, partially blocked out by towering shelves in endless rows. She squinted, but failed to detect the boundaries of the warehouse.

“Oh, this is some Area 51 shenanigans is what this is,” she told herself, whispering because if TV and film had taught her anything, it was that places like this were super secret and probably guarded by drones.

Just as she had window-shopped the maze of screen-portals, Heleth began to stroll through the rows of towering shelves. The bottom shelves held larger items – furniture on the floor, blanket boxes, trunks, even aisles full of cars from ancient to nearly new.

Woke up with a period headache this morning, which took a lot out of me. But still had good meeting with other people in my same type post around Bournemouth, and a good guest lecture with Bronwen. Got a bit of work done. And I love where this story is going at the moment - inspired by what Melissa and I tried to fund at Bangor (the secondhand shop of memories).

R: Wolf Road. W: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
As the shelves rose higher and higher toward the distant ceiling, the objects became smaller, more numerous. Heleth peered upward, squinting, spotting statues and dog houses and old console TVs like she remembered her grandparents having, when the sets were more furniture than technology. Beyond that, the objects were both too far away and too small to see clearly. She would have to find a (dangerously long) ladder to climb to see what else was up there.

She turned a corner and spotted something that made her want to cry with the sudden need of it: a bed, neatly made with worn linens and a crocheted throw folded across the bottom quarter. It was a sturdy wooden sleigh bed, the kind she’d often gazed at on blogs and home décor shows, but knew she’d never have enough money or the right kind of space to have such a thing.

As she approached it, she realized she’d been adventuring quite some time, and while she’d found food and loos, she hadn’t slept, not really. It wasn’t like there’d been plenty of cozy places to take a nap: the screen-lit expanse of the internet wasn’t terribly comfortable, and she didn’t think you *could* sleep when you were an avatar in a war game. Melatonin flooded her body, whispering to her to snuggle up with Lovelace as the little spoon, and sleep.

She placed her palm on the bed to steady herself as she toed off her slippers.

“Oh, hello! It’s so nice to have someone visit. It really has been ages, you know.”

Heleth jumped, feeling a bit of pee come out, stumbled over her half-off slipper, and landed hard on her butt in the aisle. Lovelace hissed at the disturbance and unsheathed her razors, clinging to Heleth’s gut.

“Shit–ow, *fuck*, Lovelace, get out of there!” Heleth up-ended her hoodie, dumping the spitting cat onto the concrete. She madly whipped her head around, trying to spot the source of the voice.

Terrible cramps today, not helped by having to get up early for a completely useless induction. But I made a new friend, Georgia aka SharkFriend, and maybe another one Sam, a forensic anthropologist with a skeleton named Gibbs. Sort of got stuff done today, but fairly miserable. Oh, I did wind up appearing in the induction in my cancer robe - I&#39;d thought we were done with cameras, but a speaker called me out because she&#39;d read my research blog, and there I was. Bah.

Nothing. No one. Warehouse, full of the artifacts of life, but no life to be found.

“Hello?” Heleth called. She peered through the stacks for figures on alternate aisles. “Is anyone there?”

No response. Not even a creepy giggle.

“Who are you talking to?” Lovelace asked. She bit the end of one claw and unsheathed it, making it one more atomic layer sharper. Heleth resolved to wrap herself in Kevlar before she stuck Lovelace in her hoodie the next time.

“I heard someone. Someone talked to me.”

“Are you certain it wasn’t an internal voice?”

“No,” Heleth snapped. “I’m not certain. Thanks for saying that out loud.”

The tortie yawned. “If you’re done with your dramatics, I’m going to finish my nap.” She strolled back to the bed, her eyes on the granny square blanket at its foot.

“That’s just what I was going to–”

Heleth fell mute, astonished, as the cat made her graceful leap onto the bed and took only one step atop it before springing vertically in the air. She came down with a hiss, all fur raised into a furious hackle. Spitting, she scrambled off the bed. The little cat sidled sideways, back arched, fangs exposed.

After a moment, however, she found nothing obvious to attack. She darted behind a sofa across the aisle, crouched low.

“Lovelace?” Heleth called. She attempted a soothing tone, but she could feel a bubble in her throat. It felt like laughter, but her pounding pulse and inability to take a deep breath told her it was far more likely a rising state of terror. “What is it?”

“Fuck if I know.” The cat’s voice wafted out from behind the sofa, but she herself stayed put.

“Did you hear the voice?”

“A voice, yes.”

“How come I didn’t hear it when you did?”

Heleth edged her way around to the sofa, not particularly wanting to be alone. She swiveled her head till it felt her neck would snap from material fatigue, but she saw nothing and no one.

She leaned against the couch arm, her thigh against its worn corduroy.

“Sit or stand, girl. Only hoodlums lean.”

Fairly okay day. Most of it was spent putting together a 4-min promo video for You &amp; CO2. So that was interesting. Found out last night that MMU is trying to force Amy to go in to teach face-to-face, even though Manchester is in the highest level of lockdown, there&#39;s no need for it, and she is at high risk of long-term complications from COVID-19. I contacted a Guardian reporter about it, but I doubt Amy will get in touch. Makes me crazy.

“Motherfu–” Heleth blurted, spurting back to the aisle. “Okay, it’s not fucking funny anymore. Who’s there?”

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

“Lovelace, where’s the door? We’re getting out of this funhouse.”

A pause. Lovelace’s nose and whiskers appeared around a corner of the sofa.

“Lovey?”

“No door nearby,” Lovelace said quietly. “Not that I can tell.”

Heleth froze. “Are you kidding me?”

“Do I look like a comedian?”

“Not particularly. Shit.” Heleth looked around. “Look, it’s a big place. There’s bound to be an exit portal somewhere. We just have to find it before we get brutally slaughtered or driven insane by spirits. Or whatever.”

“You go ahead. I’ll stay here.”

“Oh, for the love of… Lovelace, I can’t find a door without you! Come on, you can hide in my hoodie.”

“And get eaten at the same time you do? Thank you, no. I’ll take my chances on my own.”

Growling in frustration, Heleth marched back to the sofa and leaned over it to scoop Lovelace up. As she did, that second voice boomed again.

“Ain’t no one here going to *eat* anyone, you fools. We’re inanimate fucking objects!”

Heleth seemed to have no reflexes left. Instead of screeching and madly scanning for strangers, she stilled, one hand flat on the sofa arm while the other curled around the tortie’s abdomen.

“Who are you?” she whispered. “*Where* are you?”

“The better question in this place is *what* am I.”

“Okay, sure. What are you?” Even as she asked the question, she really wasn’t sure she wanted the answer.

“I’m a sofa. Should think that was obvious.”

Heleth yanked her hand back, tucking Lovelace against her side.

“What?” Lovelace asked.

“You didn’t hear that?”

“Hear what?”

Slowly, Heleth extended her fingertips back to the worn upholstery.

“Took you a minute, didn’t it? You gotta be touching us to talk to us.”

Better day today. Amy&#39;s coworkers arranged her contact time to be a screening, for which she doesn&#39;t have to be present. So that shenanigan is past. Got a little work done today - prepared talk for Levy Fringe Fest on YCO2 for tomorrow, read through some of the works submitted to the ELC 4, and got to read a little on my research for the Commercial DF book. Behind on everything, but what&#39;s new?

This wasn’t that bizarre, was it? She’d already seen what the internet could bring to life, from the holodeck of the *U.S.S. Enterprise* to the in-game landscape of *World of Warcraft*. So there was a warehouse full of sentient inanimate objects. It wasn’t the weirdest thing she’d ever heard of.

“Lovelace,” Heleth said, soft and steady. “The voices are the furniture.”

“Not just the furniture,” said the sofa. “Also, how would you like to be referred to as ‘furniture’?”

Heleth pulled back her arm, just for a moment. Lovelace turned her head to squint directly into Heleth’s face.

“The furniture?” Lovelace asked. “The furniture is talking to you.”

“And you,” Heleth said. “I assume you heard it when you jumped on the bed.”

One side of Lovelace’s mouth crooked, her whiskers wavering, like she had a bad smell up her nose. “I heard something. I’m not convinced yet it was the furniture.”

“Then test it, like I just did. Touch the sofa and talk to it.”

Heleth set the little cat on the concrete floor. Lovelace approached the sofa, sniffing at it. After a moment, she sat on her haunches, and with the faintest of movements, reached out one hesitating paw to place against its fabric.

Heleth resumed her contact with the sofa, listening in. The sofa’s voice, gruff and sharp with her, was gentle and soothing with the tortie.

“Hello, little one,” the sofa told her.

 In an echo of Heleth’s movements from moments ago, Lovelace jerked her paw back. Slowly, tentatively, almost like she were petting the sentient hulk, she reached out again.

“I’m only a sofa. I can think, and I can talk if you’re touching me, but I can’t move or hurt you.”

“I’m a cat,” Lovelace replied. “I can tear you to shreds.”

Heleth snorted, attempting to hold in her burst of laughter. The sofa didn’t bother. It let out a hearty guffaw, and Lovelace didn’t flinch a bit.

“I bet you can! I’d rather you didn’t, though. It would be much nicer if you curled up on one of my cushions and had a snuggle.”

Quiet day today. Paul really needed a quiet day, so I just read until a 6 Nations rugby match came on, watched that with him, did a talk on YCO2 for a fringe fest, watched a little TV, then another rugby match with him and the rugby guys on zoom. Wales has gone into a 2-week &quot;firebreak&quot; lockdown, which doesn&#39;t change my life much because I&#39;ve just been staying home for months. So whatever.

“If I do decide to have a nap, are you going to talk all the way through?”

“I’ll be quiet as a lamb.”

Lovelace tilted her head, considering. After a moment, however, she hopped up onto the sofa, padded around a bit, and settled into a loaf position, purring contentedly.

“I think,” the sofa whispered, “that if you also wanted a nap, you could try the bed again. She can contain her excitement for a minute.”

Heleth gave Lovelace a soothing stroke, then shuffled back to the bed who had first talked to her. She lay a hand on the pale pink spread.

“Would it be all–”

“Of course! Please! Get under the covers if you like. I’m very soft and warm.”

Heleth hesitated, feeling awkward at crawling *inside* a sentient being. Then she shrugged, figuring it was at least better than getting shoved into a Tauntaun, and settled in for a nap.

~

When she woke, it was to a pillow wet with her own saliva and Lovelace tucked into the dip between her ribs and her hip. She reached out without opening her eyes, fumbling for her phone. No phone.

“Ugh,” she groaned. It probably fell off her nightstand again. She couldn’t even remember what day it was, or what her work schedule was, whether she had to get up for a vid-con meeting or what.

“Did you have a nice nap?”

The voice was sweet, soothing. Motherly. Not that Heleth knew from direct experience what sincere, motherly tones sounded like. But she’d seen TV shows.

Heleth cracked an eye in confusion. Not her bedroom. Not her bed. Warehouse. In the internet. With sentient furniture.

“How long was I out?” she croaked.

“Well,” the bed replied, “I’m not particularly good at telling time in human terms, and there’s not a clock near enough to me to tell me, but based on my experience of naps and nightsleeps, I’d say you slept quite a good while! Much longer than an afternoon snooze, but not quite a full night’s sleep. You must have been very tired.”

“I guess I was,” Heleth said.

Good day today. Read some, put laundry away, sugar-washed the back hallway (SOOOO much wallpaper paste!), had a nice bath. Fairly chill. Paul has set up his office in the newly redecorated snug, and he&#39;s happy. Nice weekend overall.

Heleth had never been quick to awaken. Her college roommate had never had to hit a snooze button, always popped right up, bright as daisies. Heleth had alarm clocks in triplicate, yet she had still often managed to sleep through her first (and sometimes second) class of the day. She was sluggish and stupid for hours after waking, even after naps.

In this bizarre internet warehouse of weirdness, she was pretty certain she wasn’t going to find any stimulants to help lubricate her joints. Well, it occurred to her, it wasn’t like she was on a timetable. She could explore what it felt like to come to consciousness naturally, for once.

Slowly, so as not to disturb the gently snoring Lovelace, she snuggled deeper into the bed, closing her eyes.

“Are you,” came a gentle whisper in the bed’s voice, “going back to sleep?”

“No,” Heleth murmured. “But this is super comfy and warm and I don’t have anywhere to be. Can we talk?”

“Oh, of course!” This was filled with such enthusiasm that the mattress almost felt like it trembled. “It’s been so so so long since I had anyone else to talk to.”

“I get that.” Heleth felt floaty. Floaty and warm. “Can you all, you know, talk to each other?”

“Yes. But only to those near us. And it’s not like we ever get rotated here. We all know our neighbors’ stories backwards and frontwards.”

“What is this place?”

There was a long silence, and Heleth felt herself drifting away, her mind beginning to play make believe with itself. Then the bed spoke again.

“There are a lot of questions hidden within the answer to that. Where we are. What we are. How we came to be. Where we *used* to be.”

“Those are all really good questions,” Heleth said thickly.

Monday! But still a good day. Had a message off Amy at about 10:30 that her uni needed a short description and budget for her two projects they might have last-minute money for by noon, and she didn&#39;t think she could do it. I made her get on the horn with me and we made it happen! I cleared out my email inbox, sent a few emails I should have sent last week, reviewed a few entries for the ELCv4, then read a book for research on my book. Good day! Paul&#39;s all moved into his new office, and he actually finished his workday by dinnertime, so he was much less stressed and grumpy. A good day overall.

“Perhaps the best question of all,” the bed told her, “is *why* are we?”

“Oh dear,” Heleth said. “That’s very deep.”

The bed did not reply, and Heleth instantly regretted her flippant tone.

“So,” she ventured softly, “how is it that you came to be?”

Another long silence. Heleth’s pulse rose: she was nestled in a being that she had clearly upset. How to extricate herself from that level of awkwardness?

Finally, before she could move, the bed responded, her voice muted. “We are not normal.”

“No, I suppose not.”

“Yet there are thousands of us. From so many different regions, so many different time periods. Our stories ripple through us like waves. We pass them down as we hear them, and they flow across the warehouse until they bounce back to us. There’s a claddagh ring somewhere that a man gave to his lover in the 1700s. She wore it till the day she died, even though he went to sea before their first child was born and never returned.

“There’s a wind-up radio that helped its owners to safety when the Fukushima plant melted down. And a horse bit from a Mongolian archer who rode across Asia alone just to see what was out there.

HOW IS OCTOBER ALMOST DONE? THIS IS NOT FAIR! TOMORROW I WILL BE 80 AND WILL HAVE WASTED MY LIFE!

Otherwise, it&#39;s been a good day. Updated the YCO2 presentation, had a good chat with network contact, figured out some updates to the IDN. Pretty quiet, overall.

Today Paul and I played a little game: if you could only keep 3 things (inanimate objects, not critters or people), what would they be?

Paul kept his Akubra, his knife, and a BBQ (I said his mother&#39;s pictures, his knife, and his mandolin). He amended and said if hats are clothing (which doesn&#39;t count), then he&#39;d take a bow.

I kept my Prestige jump saddle, my covers, and a set of crochet hooks (Paul said my horse trailer, a saddle, and a set of crochet hooks). I amended that with the hooks, I could make new covers, so replaced them with a kindle/book.

The not-so-inanimate item of furniture fell quiet, and Heleth found she had no words either. After a long while, she asked, “Does no one here have any answers?”

“We have pieces. Every so often a tale trickles through, in bits and pieces. But there are so many of us, and we cannot move. Not a single one of us has the power of locomotion, not even the vehicles. By the time a story comes to us, it’s softened by the many who have told it. Warped and transformed into ghosts and possibilities.”

Heleth sat up. Well, she rolled around for a bit like an overturned tortoise, as Lovelace’s weight threw off her balance just enough to make the simple rise to sitting a tortuous one. The cat furthered her non-help by refusing to budge; as Heleth moved, she simply surfed the human’s body, a liquid ooze filling a gravity well. Eventually, however, Heleth managed the maneuver.

Though she was still cross-legged on the mattress, she reached out a hand and palmed the headboard. “I could help. I mean, if you would like that. I can move. I can talk to peop–er, well, I can listen and try to put a history together.”

For a moment, she thought she’d overstepped. Then the bed responded, and Heleth could hear, no, she could almost *feel* the tremble vibrating under her hand.

“Could you? Would you really do that?”

“I don’t see why not.”

“Oh, you can’t imagine how happy that would make me. Make us! So many of us. To know why we’re here, how we came to be, what all of this means…”

“I can’t make any guarantees, you know,” Heleth said quickly. “At the end of the day, this whole place might just be filled with fragments and rumors that never make any sense to anyone.”

“But even then, we’d know something. We’d know there’s nothing to know! It would be such a difference.”

Heleth smiled.

Good day again. Didn&#39;t have any commitments, so had a nice walk in the field, worked on updating NW4T with mouseover effects for the harder words, lunged Jake in his new lunging gear (dramatic), and hung out with Paul. A nice day.

“Fair enough,” she said. She poked Lovelace, who was lolling on her back, her belly to the air. The cat purred and stretched, an open invitation for a belly rub.

“What kind of an idiot do you take me for?” Heleth asked her.

Lovelace yawned. “The gullible kind.”

“Hardy har. Come on. We have a mission.”

“I heard. It seems like the kind of thing you don’t really need a cat for.”

“Seriously, Lovey? You’re just going to have a snooze while I wander this place all by myself?”

“Yes, thank you, I like that idea.”

Heleth puffed out a breath and rolled herself off the bed. She scooped the tortie up and tucked her under one arm.

“This is undignified,” Lovelace commented, letting her whole body go slack.

“You started it,” Heleth told her. She reached out her free arm to the bed again, asking, “This box I have. Can I leave it here and pick it up later? No sense lugging it around.”

If the bed could have gasped, it did. “Of course! Leave it wherever – there’s no one to steal it. But if you’re worried, you can leave it underneath me. It’s a favorite hiding spot.”

Murmuring in agreement, Heleth slid the box under the bed. “Okay. Here we go. Any suggestions on which direction to start?”

“I haven’t a clue,” the bed said. “Perhaps it’s worth devising some sort of system?”

“Good idea.”

“Good god almighty,” Lovelace said, writhing. “Put me down.”

“Where did you even pick that phrase up?” Heleth laughed, setting the cat on the floor. “Have you been watching that catfishing show again?”

“Just follow me. You wouldn’t know a systematic approach to gathering information if it fell on your head.” The cat trotted off, her tail in the air.

“Welp, I guess that’s settled. See you all later.”

Good day again today. Terrible weather, so stayed in my PJs. Worked on version 2.0 of No World 4 Tomorrow, and got an audio toggle working. It was much harder than I anticipated, but at least I got it done before midnight. Otherwise, not much happening here today.

OH! Except an amazing quote from the Cat Valente book I&#39;m listening to (Space Opera): &quot;Every child in the galaxy learns the truth about politics at their mother&#39;s proboscis. For lo, does not Goginar&#39;s Third Unkillable fact tell us: &#39;though any species on any dumb gob-world may develop sentience, the poor bastards, no government ever does.&#39;&quot; Just brilliant, especially right now.

R: Black Sun, Space Opera. W: Paul watched some The Tick, but I was coding. I don&#39;t like it enough. L: 0.
[continue]
Without the capability for physical contact as she walked away, Heleth felt her leaving lacked the ceremony it deserved. No one could even shout “Good luck!” much less wave her on her way.

Feeling out-of-sorts from the anticlimax, Heleth wandered after Lovelace, who had no time for dilly-dallying. Nor for lollygagging.

“Lovelace, slow down! I only have two legs.”

“It’s not my fault your ancestors evolved to make two of your legs useless.”

Heleth huffed. “I hardly think fingers and opposable thumbs are useless.”

“Do they help you run faster?”

“Obviously not.”

“Do you have razor claws for snaring whatever food you want?”

“Sigh.” Heleth actually said this out loud. “No, I do not have razor claws for snaring food.”

“Then they seem fairly useless to me.”

“Fine. You’re right. They’re useless.”

At this concession, Lovelace slowed a mite. 

Heleth peered around at all the objects they were marching past, knowing they all had stories, and that thanks to the warehouse grapevine they probably all knew her purpose. She imagined them screaming internally for her attention. It made her feel watched, yet also needed.

“What’s the systematic plan, then, oh wise and usefully four-footed leader?”

“We start in the middle.”

“What? I would have started at a corner, going up and down aisles like a grid.”

The cat switched her tail in irritation. “That is exactly why I am directing this search and not you. I don’t have the rest of my lives to spend in here, do you?”

“Obviously not.” Though at some point in her life, she hoped she would stop getting schooled by a domestic pet.

“Trying to sample everything would take decades in a territory this large. And based on the bed – did you even *try* to get a name? Social niceties really are beyond you, aren’t they? – based on how the bed claims information travels in here, the most consistent information will be in the middle of the warehouse.”

Nice lazy day today. Woke up to a massive storm, came downstairs, curled up on the sofa while Paul watched an episode of The Tick. I fell asleep again, Paul went grocery shopping, I got up and had breakfast around noon. Chilled out reading for a while, then finally did some spackling in the front hallway. Talked to Kate &amp; them for Halloween chat. Watched some 6 Nations Rugby, read some more. Fairly chill.

“The Cataloguer!” the pen piped. Its voice was whistling, like air streaming through its capsule. “Do you know them?”

“I don’t,” Heleth replied, wondering if she made Lovelace feel this cross-eyed. “That’s why I asked. Who is the Cataloguer?”

“All items in the warehouse are catalogued, obviously. *Some*body has to do it.”

“But you’ve never met them? What about when you were catalogued?”

The notebook responded, its voice more of a crackly scratch, like crumpling paper. “Don’t remember.”

“Then how do you know you were catalogued?”

This gave the stationery pause. Heleth relished the silence as Lovelace began to take more turns as she squirrelled in toward the rough center of the warehouse.

“We just were,” the pen finally said.

“All righty then,” Heleth said. The office supplies resumed their general chatter, and she did her best to shove their wittering to the back of her attention.

Lovelace announced their arrival in “the middle” by seating herself in the middle of the aisle, rolling her bum under, and beginning a systematic wash of her delicates.

“Class, Lovey,” Heleth commented. “Class all the way.”

Lovelace ignored her. One must maintain a routine, it seemed, even in the most extraordinary of circumstances.

“Okay then.” Heleth looked around her. Nothing here that was any more or less interesting than any other aisle or shelf. The ground level was packed with furniture, a few odd bits of what she assumed was farm equipment (never really having seen any), and some various large works of what she could only assume was sculpture. She was about as good with art as she was with tractors. Despite some large pieces, she noted there was nothing resembling industrial machinery. No assembly lines, no cargo ships, no bulldozers. Everything in the warehouse was something that once belonged to someone, perhaps a procession of someones.

That was a start. She jotted it down on the first page of the notebook, feeling rather clever. The pen and page never stopped nattering at each other.

Good day today, if somewhat unproductive. Jake got new shoes, I met a colleague in English, and did the coding for the departmental stuff. Always takes longer than I want! But done.

“I don’t… I mean, it’s a bed. Do you think it has a name?”

Lovelace sped up.

“Wait! Okay, the middle. Is that because… Well, because, um.” Heleth thought madly, because she’d never started *anything* in the middle. She ate oatmeal by scraping around the cooling outside of the bowl. She ate her crusts first, saving the tasty middle for last. She never picked up a TV show halfway through – she either found its pilot and caught up, or she didn’t watch at all.

In a singsong voice that sounded far too much like a kindergarten teacher barely holding in homicidal urges, Lovelace told her, “We start in the middle, like I already said, because it will have the most consistent information. We get a good summary there. Then we spiral out – we don’t have to hit every neighborhood, just get an idea of what stories are circulating where. If we find something interesting, we dig deeper in that spot, and continue on.”

Heleth trudged behind the smug cat for a while. “Yeah, okay, you’re right. I can’t think of a better way to do it.”

Lovelace sneezed, and Heleth could totally tell it was not a real sneeze.

After a bit, Heleth had no idea where they were at all – middle, corner, or alternate universe. She just knew this was a massive place with a very hard floor underneath her murder-bunny slippers.

They paused briefly for Heleth to climb, at Lovelace’s insistence and amusement, to a shelf about three stories above them for a notebook and a pen. Both objects immediately told her they were so excited she chose them, and they knew just what she was doing, and they hoped so dearly that her travels would reveal the Cataloguer, and give them their purpose.

“The who what now?” Heleth asked. She had to carry the objects, which mean she was always in contact with them. Their chatter was already bouncing around her skull more than she would have liked.

Not much news. Still pants weather. England went into a 4-week lockdown today. No surprise. It won&#39;t help, because everyone is a moron, but whatever. Got up, had breakfast, read for a while, chatted with Catrin P about ex-racers, and did some more spackling. Finished reading Space Opera (super fun) and Black Sun (really good), started on Binti. W: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
Lovelace had applied systematic thinking to the entire warehouse. Heleth would have to do the same, or she would never get out of there. She decided to sample only one shelf per stop, to ask for the local who’d been there the longest and/or who knew the most stories, jot down what she could, and go from there. Since she’d stayed on ground level with the sofa and the bed, she found a rolling ladder/platform and climbed a few steps to peek in at the next shelf up.

“Hello,” she whispered, looking around. Here, the items were still large, but most she thought she could perhaps move on her own if she really needed to. A large toy box. A trunk. Luggage full of stickers from all over the world. Smaller pieces of furniture like coffee tables and nightstands.

“I suppose you all know why I’m here. I’m very sorry I can’t speak to all of you, as I know you all have very interesting stories. But, you see, the warehouse is very large, and there are very very many of you, and if I am to make some semblance of progress in figuring out your collective history, I can’t spend the rest of my life doing it. So I’m taking samples from all around the warehouse. Here, this shelf in this spot is a sample. Within my reach, I’d like to speak to the one of you who has been here the longest, or is the best storyteller. I hope you can all agree on that. Ready?”

Heleth took a deep breath and reached out to the nearest object: a large storage trunk that, based on its decoration, had either contained gear for an equestrian, or all the dreams of a horse-crazy young person. She hoped for the former, but wasn’t certain there was really much of a difference between the two. Surely everyone who wanted to sit on the back of a three-quarter ton animal with a brain the size of a walnut was at least a little insane.

Departmental day at work today. Lot of screen time, but wasn&#39;t a lot of stupid waffle, and some good interaction with colleagues, and an escape room at the end. So it was a good experience, as far as all-day meetings go. Horrific weather again this evening, but Paul, Newt and I got out for a field walk at lunchtime, and Jake got his blanket for the first time this year. Tomorrow it&#39;s up early to get vehicle in for MOT. Bah.

R: Binti, The Haunting of Tram Car 015 W: Brave New World L: 0
[continue]
The tack trunk had a voice like five hundred miles of bad road. Had it been a person, Heleth rather thought it would be speaking through a hole in its throat.

“It ain’t me you’re wanting,” the trunk told her. “Not unless you want to hear about every horse whose boots I ever kept. These bastards don’t seem to enjoy my stories half as much as you’d think they should.”

“Oh no,” Heleth replied. She didn’t want to confess that she wasn’t terribly interested in horse stories either. Cats were amazing, but horses were just a bit too large to be anything but nerve-wracking. “Is there someone I should–”

“That bedtable over there. Don’t look like much, but ‘at bird can wrap a tale around you like a fleece blanket.”

Thanking the creaky old box, Heleth shifts her body so she can both set her fingers against the nightstand’s base and jot notes in her notebook. She shushes the pen and notepad, trying to get some semblance of quiet for concentration’s sake, and wraps her hand around one table leg.

“Hullo,” said the table. Its voice was rich and deep, far too big and bold for such a simple little wooden nightstand with only one drawer.

“Hi,” Heleth said. “Do you know why I’m here?”

“I have an inkling. Is there somewhere in particular you’d like me to start?”

“Oh, um…” Heleth looked down to Lovelace, uncertain. “I think, maybe – what’s the oldest thing you remember?”

The little cat bounced up the stairs to join her, leaning against the nightstand so she could also hear its tale.

“That could go two ways, couldn’t it?” the bedtable began. “That could be my very first memory, or it could be the oldest story I know of in this place. They’re not the same thing, you know. But that’s all right. I’ll tell you both. I just needed a moment to order things in my mind.

I am a day behind because yesterday was election day and I stayed up till 3am and yet it&#39;s now almost midnight the next day and we still don&#39;t know. It looks like Biden, but it could all still go tits up. I was coding on NW4T version 2 until 3am, distracting myself from the coverage. Then didn&#39;t sleep well, and woke up at 830, and got up for the English, History &amp; Law research day, as I was giving a talk and wanted to participate anyway. That went well, but I&#39;ve been useless the rest of the day.

“As I’m sure you can imagine, the passage of time in this place is difficult to measure. There is little pattern to how the warehouse fills. New additions sometimes simply appear. Less often, they disappear. I am not the eldest of the occupants. Many preceded me. But my location has yielded me many connections, many tales.

“When I arrived, I believe I was already fifty years old, in the service world. I was made by a local craftsman for a girl’s bedroom, and I lived by her side for thirty years, when she gave me to her daughter. Her daughter placed me in the guest bedroom of her very first home, and I was there until she remodeled. I do not know how I got from there to here. I simply… was.

“Like many, I was confused. I was certain there was some mistake. I had a purpose, a job, a location, an environment. And suddenly, I didn’t. I was shelved. Stored away where no one ever came. I was despondent.”

Heleth’s eyes well. She considered all those animated films that anthropomorphized objects, giving them lives and feelings and desires. *Beauty and the Beast*, *Toy Story*. She’d loved the story of *The Indian in the Cupboard* as a child, though looking back it seemed rather problematic. Of course, given all the objects in her life she had broken, discarded, abandoned, ignored, given away, and even burned, she wondered if she was perhaps something of a monster.

“The stories here rescued me. Objects from all over the world, all over time. From palaces and hovels. Jewels and smoking pipes, rocking horses and wardrobes. The oldest item I’m aware of is a corn cob doll. Oh, there may be older, of course. The world is so much older than I can imagine. But that’s the oldest I know. She comes from the Americas, before they were the Americas. Before the wheel and ships and blankets and whiskey bottles.”

Fecking Guy Fawkes&#39; Day. Lockdown means no community bonfires and fireworks, so the asshats did their own. Walked out to close the chickens up for the night and Cari&#39;s field was on fire. Not really, but the neighbors on the other side had a massive bonfire practically in field&#39;s hedge. Horses were spooky, but seemed okay, but I worried about them so I brought them in. Put Cari in Jake&#39;s stall because Paul is still using her stall for furniture storage, and Jake in the stable yard. They calmed down almost immediately.

Otherwise, today fairly normal. Finally got some sleep. Still don&#39;t know the election results. Bah.

“What’s her story?” Heleth breathed.

“The corn cob doll? Oh, give me just a moment to recall.”

Heleth waited patiently, listening to Lovelace’s contented purr as she rested, loaf position, leaning against the nightstand’s leg.

“She was made in a long winter, when food stores had all but dried up and the people were starving. Did you know,” the nightstand said, her tone shifting somewhat, “that almost all the names for tribes you have translate, in their native tongue, to ‘the people’? Why wouldn’t they, after all? But we have all these names for foreigners, and others, and those who aren’t like us, and in the end we all call ourselves the same thing.

“Anyway, her people were starving. To occupy her mind and her hands, a woman took the corn cob and fashioned her into a little figure. Head, torso. Sewed on some leathers, painted on a face, stitched in some of the cornsilk for hair. When she was done she gave the corn cob doll to her granddaughter, who was only just beginning to be a girl instead of a baby, able to walk and talk and help her family with small chores, but still young enough to be soothed by the false presence of a tiny human-ish figure keeping her company in the cold, dark nights.

“The winter dragged on, and people began dying. The first to pass were the weakest: the very young, the very old, the ill, the injured. Based on the way the world is now, you might think they were focusing on feeding their children first, and then the parents, but that comes from living in a world of plenty, where there are others about to take care of your offspring if you are not able to. But this is long, long ago, when humans were much closer to the earth, not yet masters of nature, and they scrabbled for survival every way they could.”

Feeling a bit better today seeing that Biden has flipped PA and GA. The fascist cheeto is out, thank goodness. Only a couple more months of him as Pres, then he&#39;s just a has-been who can be indicted. Fairly good day here on the farm, with a nice walk in the sunshine, some good work done, started on a Twine escape room for the Dec staff do.

Heleth looked at the notebook, at the pen in her hand. She’d only managed to write “corn cob doll – grandmother – starving.” How was that in any way a facsimile of the story she was hearing from this nightstand, this inanimate object, this castaway piece of furniture? It wasn’t really the story of the corn cob doll so much as it was the humans who made and loved and cared for her. Humans hundreds, perhaps thousands of years dead.

“The grandmother passed away, her heart damaged by ongoing malnutrition. But the little girl held on, and made it through the winter. She herself lived to be an old woman with many grandchildren of her own, and made them many corn cob dolls herself. She never gave away the doll her grandmother made for her, however; she kept the ancient doll to honour her grandmother’s memory and sacrifice.”

The story over, the nightstand fell silent. Lovelace yawned and stretched her paws, briefly flashing her needle-sharp claws.

“Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for?”

Heleth considered. “I don’t know,” she said. “I’ve only just started. I am hoping to discover more about why you’re all here. Who brought you, who collected you, how you came to… well, to be able to think and speak to one another and to me.”

“Oh, goodness. That’s quite a tall order!”

“I know it is. I’m sorry to pester you, but have you heard anything of the sort? Origin stories, I guess?”

“Yes, I’ve heard many. But none I could say were true. They come in waves, you know? For a while it was that we were all cursed. Some stories had us all cursed by different witches or warlocks or whatever term they felt like using. Seemed rather chaotic and senseless, all of us with random curses winding up in the exact same place in the exact same state.

“Then it was that we all suffered the *same* curse, which obviously makes more sense, but not by much. Who would curse a universe worth of inanimate objects? Why store them? What did we do to deserve it? Curses can always be lifted – why can’t ours? You see, it’s ridiculous.”

Lovelace slowly blinked her eyes at Heleth. She knew what was coming. Heleth could guess, and the fact that Lovelace was watching smugly for her reaction meant that it was a not-nice outcome from a human perspective. From a cat perspective? Lovelace would probably only be satisfied if somehow a toddler got eaten.

Unaware, the bedstand continued her tale. “The people loved their children very much, just as much as any mother loves her child now, but they also knew how much harder life could be. They knew that if their child survived and they did not, that life for that child would be harsh. Perhaps it would even be deadly, dying of exposure, starvation. If they lived, perhaps they would be mistreated. Perhaps, even worse, they would be abandoned.

“So they did not do as you probably suppose. They did not fill their children’s bellies at the expense of their own. They didn’t starve the little ones, of course, but they didn’t favor them. The strong would survive, the weak would be mourned, but the tribe would continue with more capable members.

“Except this little girl was so special to her grandmother. In warmer days she had brought her grandmother flowers to prompt her smile. She would hold her grandmother’s cold, gnarled hand between her own, warming the ache out of them. There was a simple kindness in the girl that her grandmother knew her people sorely needed. Hard times like those often weeded out the kind with the weak, not able to tell the difference, leaving the people alive but angry and bitter. Kindness would be necessary in the coming years, she knew.

“So the grandmother made her the corn cob doll, which the girl kept with her night and day. She slipped her bits of extra rations when she could. She felt herself weaken, becoming shaky in her limbs and wandering in her mind, but she focused on the girl. On her smile, her teeth that had yet to grow to permanence.”

Very good Saturday. Slept in, got breakfast, snuggled on the sofa with dog, cat, coffee, and book. Started and finished reading *The Haunting of Tram Car 015*, which was fun. Started reading another. Went for a walk, lunged Jake and then spent some time with him just grooming his mane. Oddly, he was very sweet, and even though he had no halter on just stood for brushing and even a little pulling. Then worked on spackling the back hall (these walls really should have had a skim coat, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s within my ability, so massive spackle it was...). Took a break to see to chickens and Jake&#39;s blanket to find BIDEN WON AND THE ORANGE TURD IS FIRED. So brilliant. Ate lasagne and garlic bread, finished spackling, and am now ready for bed.

“Indeed,” Lovelace agreed. “Entirely inefficient as well.”

“There’s also the notion that we are not objects at all, merely spirits trapped in objects.”

“That sounds promising,” Heleth said.

“No,” the nightstand said quickly. “Not when you consider not a single one of us has any memory of ever being anything other than what we are. Some think perhaps we are the products of godly – or technologically capable to the point of godliness – experimentation with sentience. That a powerful being imbued us with souls, or artificial consciousness. And then abandoned us, we would have to assume. That one is often very popular, coming around on a regular basis, but I simply find it too sad to be true.”

Heleth asked hesitantly, “Do you have your own theory? A story you believe?”

If a piece of furniture could sigh, the nightstand did. “I will tell you what I believe, and now that you have heard the corn cob doll’s story, I think you will agree it makes a great deal of sense. I believe the objects in this warehouse somehow received a portion of humanity. Call it what you like. A part of a human’s soul. A piece of their self. Some element of energy that is the stuff of which life is made. And it changed us, and we are alive and yet not alive. We will not die naturally, and to destroy us would not only be murder, but genocide of epic proportions.

“If one were to collect all the stories in this place, you see, you would have the entirety of human history. Not facts and dates the way you humans like to record it. But the truly lived lives of ordinary – and some extraordinary, I’m sure – people. What a wondrous thing that would be.”

Heleth blinked. She hadn’t thought of it that way.

“What about cats?” Lovelace asked.

“Cats?” the nightstand repeated.

I barely slept at all last night because of anxiety-brain over talking to Dad about his Republican insanity. I finally fell asleep around 8am, and slept till 1pm. Not great for my sleep schedule (as evidenced by the fact I am actually writing this at 2am on 10 Nov). Fairly sedate day, though, just catching up on emails and bitty tasks.

“Cats are important,” Lovelace said. “Who’s recording our history?”

“I hadn’t ever considered that,” the bedtable told her, somewhat befuddled.

“Don’t worry,” Heleth said. “No one expects you to.”

“I do,” said Lovelace.

“What would the history of cats even be?” Heleth asked. “‘5000 B.C.: Ra the scrawny makes himself at home in a grain store. He eats mice, so the humans let him be. When he gets itchy, he begs a human for scritches, and they oblige, and he pays them with a pleasant rumbling.’ It’s not exactly riveting.”

“I could say the same about the endless human loop of enslaving and killing one another, usually over imaginary father figures or variations in hormonal levels.”

“I wish I could tell you you were wrong,” Heleth said. “But you’re not wrong.”

Lovelace paid her with a pleasant rumbling.

To the nightstand, Heleth said, “Thank you, er… do you have a name?”

“Who would have ever given me a name? I have neither parents nor caretakers.”

Heleth wasn’t sure, but she heard a note of sadness, maybe even bitterness, in the comment. “Would you like one?” Heleth asked.

“I have a catalogue number. It’s enough. There is no one who would ever use my name were I to have one.”

“Even so, it’s okay to want one, to have one, to know that that special arrangement of letters represents you to the world.”

“If I may be honest,” Lovelace said, as if she were ever anything but brutally so, “humans like to give things names so they can shout at them. Names are overrated.”

“You wouldn’t get shouted at so much if you didn’t tip over every drink I’ve ever set on a surface.”

Lovelace simply resumed purring.

“It’s not a resounding defense,” the nightstand said, and this time she sounded amused. “I believe I’ll pass, thank you.”

Heleth made niceties before withdrawing her hand, scribbling down a few extra notes in her book, and descending the ladder. “C’mon, Lovey,” she called. “We’re on to the next stop!”

Once again, I am writing this in the wee hours in the morning. Rather dumb, really, as I have a 9am tomorrow. Idjit.

Fairly standard day, but tons of zoom meetings. It&#39;s going to be like that this week. Tiring.

For what felt like days, Heleth followed Lovelace in a spiral. Though she had previously fallen victim to all the woes and worries of having a living, breathing, consuming, expelling human body, somehow all of those biological functions entered a state of pause in the Everything is Alive warehouse. Ironically, she thought, it was as though she were no longer quite as alive as she usually was in this vast store of conscious inanimate objects. Everything was alive, but in this place being hungry and needing to pee were highly inconvenient, and so they were suspended.

She tired on a regular schedule, however, though she tried to convince both herself and Lovelace that it was only a mental condition—the *expectation* of growing tired. Lovelace would have none of it. “Napping” clearly formed the foundation of the cat’s personal pyramid of hierarchical needs.

Heleth’s notebook became full of stories, as each location she collected from filled in bits and pieces. For a time, she heard echoes of the nightstand’s tale of the [[corn cob doll]]. As she moved farther out on Lovelace’s plotted spiral, the historic tales began to shift. The corn cob doll was *not* the oldest object known by the time she reached the shelf labelled 5.0803x-2.8560 (the warehouse seemed to be mapped not by a library system or a storage system, but by something approximating GPS coordinates, a discovery that made Heleth happy to join Lovelace in her next nap just so she could stop obsessing over how vast the place really was) was a small soapstone figurine of a woman’s figure. Like the corn cob doll, no one quite knew where the resting place of the [[goddess]] (for that was how they referred to her) actually was, but she had a tale that certainly rivalled the corn cob doll for drama.

Rather busy day for me. Paul took Newt on hike with rugby friends, so I took the opportunity to sand the back hallway. Then because today was new chicken day, I went out and made a mesh barricade between the chicken shed and run, so the new chickens can get used to stuff without Kara and Rita bullying them to death. I also fixed the chicken shed window—wind had caught it and the glass broke, so I needed to board it up. Then finally to pick up chickens! New ladies are Michael Birdham, Nurse Mildred Hatched, and Bockett Mariner. No idea yet which is which! Then evening of horror movies and one (lesbian!) xmas romance. Tomorrow might be a duvet day.

The stories she heard about the origins of the warehouse were vague and sketchy and had all the hallmarks of speculation and rumour rather than any actual veracity. Only one theme emerged over and over: the notion of a Cataloguer.

The figure emerged as a broach told them a tale of high society and piracy. Heleth found it rather romantic and adventurous, like a Regency novel. The broach only mentioned the Catalogue in passing, and when Heleth pressed, simply said, “You know, whoever catalogues us. We’re all catalogued,” and carried on.

A few stops later a first edition of *The Hobbit* (which she considered taking for herself until she began to wonder if it would count as kidnapping) posed a question that even Lovelace hadn’t thought of: if there’s a Cataloguer, then where’s the Catalogue?

Once that question emerged, she and Lovelace altered their strategy somewhat. They began to focus on books, the bigger the better. It meant a lot of climbing; as smaller items, the books were housed in the upper quarter of the shelves. After quite a bit of huffing and puffing, Lovelace took pity on her—in the form of an eyeroll—and climbed up to trot along the higher shelves, scouting for possibilities.

“This is stupid,” she finally said, bouncing down a set of stairs and rolling to her back on the floor. She had a good squirrel and scratch. “If the Catalogue were here, someone would *know*.”

Heleth sighed. “You’re right.” She copped a squat next to Lovelace and took the exposed belly as an invitation to be overly familiar. The tortie didn’t shred her hand, so it must have been okay. “I just don’t understand what we’re doing here. There’s been no sign of a door out whatsoever?”

“None, nada, zilch.”

Heleth opened her notes on her knee and leafed through them. “We have a ton of stories here, and they’re amazing. That Cabbage Patch Doll alone could be the base of a whole series of bestsellers. I mean, dang.”

**The corn cob doll**

She was made in a long winter, when food stores had all but dried up and the people were starving. Did you know that almost all the names for different human tribes translate, in their native tongue, to ‘the people’? Why wouldn’t they, after all? But we have all these names for foreigners, and others, and those who aren’t like us, and in the end we all call ourselves the same thing.

Anyway, her people were starving. To occupy her mind and her hands, a woman took the corn cob and fashioned her into a little figure. Head, torso. Sewed on some leathers, painted on a face, stitched in some of the cornsilk for hair. When she was done she gave the corn cob doll to her granddaughter, who was only just beginning to be a girl instead of a baby, able to walk and talk and help her family with small chores, but still young enough to be soothed by the false presence of a tiny human-ish figure keeping her company in the cold, dark nights.

The winter dragged on, and people began dying. The first to pass on were the weakest: the very young, the very old, the ill, the injured. Based on the way the world is now, you might think they were focusing on feeding their children first, and then the parents, but that comes from living in a world of plenty, where there are others around to take care of your offspring if you are not able to. But this is long, long ago, when humans were much closer to the earth, not yet masters of nature, and they scrabbled for survival every way they could.

The people loved their children very much, just as much as any mother loves her child now, but they also knew how much harder life could be. They knew that if their child survived and they did not, that life for that child would be harsh. Perhaps it would even be deadly, dying of exposure, starvation. If they lived, perhaps they would be mistreated. Perhaps, even worse, they would be abandoned.

So they did not do as you probably suppose. They did not fill their children’s bellies at the expense of their own. They didn’t starve the little ones, of course, but they didn’t favor them. The strong would survive, the weak would be mourned, but the tribe would continue with more capable members.

Except this little girl was so special to her grandmother. In warmer days she had brought her grandmother flowers to prompt her smile. She would hold her grandmother’s cold, gnarled hand between her own, warming the ache out of them. There was a simple kindness in the girl that her grandmother knew her people sorely needed. Hard times like those often weeded out the kind with the weak, not able to tell the difference, leaving the people alive but angry and bitter. Kindness would be necessary in the coming years, she knew.

So the grandmother made her the corn cob doll, which the girl kept with her night and day. She slipped her bits of extra rations when she could. She felt herself weaken, becoming shaky in her limbs and wandering in her mind, but she focused on the girl. On her smile, her teeth that had yet to grow to permanence.

The grandmother passed away, her heart damaged by ongoing malnutrition. But the little girl held on, and made it through the winter. She herself lived to be an old woman with many grandchildren of her own, and made them many corn cob dolls herself. She never gave away the doll her grandmother made for her, however; she kept the ancient doll to honour her grandmother’s memory and sacrifice.

Actually writing this at a reasonable hour (11pm) tonight! I finished my website coding today, which is what always turns me obsessive (next obsession: the escape room code for the Xmas staff do). Lot of time on zoom today (and even more tomorrow), and I&#39;m knackered.

Apart from 45 being as massive a dick as we assumed he would be and not conceding the office or committing to a peaceful transition, not a ton going on in the world. Oh, wait—Pfizer announced a COVID vaccine that&#39;s supposed to be 90% effective. Still in trials, still a long way from manufacture and distribution, but promising anyway. Of course people immediately set Twitter trending with &quot;thalidamide&quot;, which is incredibly worrying regarding whether enough people will accept the vaccine to get us out of this pandemic.

**The goddess**

The goddess was carved long before her maker really had such a word. Before humans had collectively begun to stare up at the heavens and wonder what sort of power could craft such a world and place them in it. When people were only just beginning to put together words into structures with beginnings, middles, and ends.

The one who crafted her was changing. She had been a child, and then a mother many times over. She had survived when many did not. She was skilled at foraging, able to discern the trickiest edible mushroom or berry from those that would cause cramping, hallucinations, and even death. She was only one step away from cultivation in her patch of savannah, knowing when and where and how much to harvest to ensure a continual cycle of renewal and fresh pickings.

But she had three daughters now, and one son, and she had passed on to them the knowledge that she could, and what gathering she did was only for her own pride. They provided for her now, mostly, and she was beginning to settle into her twilight years. Her age showed in her body, as the muscles, though still strong and supple, nonetheless began to wane and soften, her skin becoming thinner so that it could no longer hold itself and its fatty layer taut. Her hips were wide, her breasts tired, and her monthly cycle had sputtered to a stop. She was old, but her people were wealthy—meaning, they had enough food and shelter to care for her in her final years.

She found herself, more and more often, without a task or a chore to occupy her time. It was a completely foreign state of being—since she’d been able to walk, she’d been able to pick, to tan, to grind, to sew, to cut, to mash. Every year had the potential to be the last year for her people, if they did not gather and store sufficient food in the spring and summer for the winter, if they did not repair and renew their tools and clothes in the winter. There was always something to do.

So tired. 7 hours on zoom today. Just want to not look at a computer screen.

Only now she had an hour or two each day that were not filled. Sometimes she spent time watching the tribe’s children, both in making sure they didn’t kill or maim themselves or each other, and in laughing at their bubbling antics. Sometimes someone or other sat with her, asked her questions, listened to her stories. Sometimes her grandchildren—for they were grown enough to work—asked her to help them sort their gatherings, or direct them where to look.

But often she had no one to talk to and nothing to do. On a recent walk, she had found a piece of soapstone, about as large as her two fists pressed together, and she picked it up and kept it. It had a natural shape to it that was familiar, but that she couldn’t put a finger to just yet. She cupped it in her hand, rubbed it, turned it this way and that, until finally she determined that its current shape was hiding its true form. She would have to help it.

She didn’t have much of an inkling of how to start. She had no one to show her, to teach her. So she just did her best, and luckily for her soapstone is rather pliable, for stone. She used other rocks, those with harder and sharper edges, to abrade away the bits that didn’t seem to fit. She plucked through dulled hiding knives and broken spearheads to find tools that would help.

She didn’t rush it. She was old, she knew, but she wasn’t rotting away. She could take her time. There were some sessions where she didn’t shape the stone at all—she just looked at it, examined it, rolled it around.

Eventually, it began to resemble the figure she’d seen in her mind when she first picked it up. Its egg shape had given way to a rounded top, a flared and undulating middle, and a tapered bottom.

On I keep going with this - though today is the last day of the goddess. Tired today, felt really poorly. Took my walk with Newt and lunged Jake, and actually felt okay while I was outside, but then came in and felt awful. Started a fire by like 1pm even though it wasn&#39;t cold, just so I could feel better. But it was a good day work-wise; finished up some tasks that this zoom-heavy week didn&#39;t let me get to, cleared out my inbox, and this evening I even completed the framework for the holiday escape room we&#39;re making for the staff holiday event. So that&#39;s all right.

She wasn’t sure when she first knew for sure what the figure would be. Perhaps it was the moment she sliced a cleft between the chunky legs. Perhaps it was the way its middle made a pear shape, plump and ample. Perhaps she never planned it at all, and it emerged because it already was. When she was finished, however, it was clear enough to anyone who might see it: it was the figure of a woman.

Not the figure of a woman as she rises from girlhood to adulthood, her skin taught, her belly flat, her breasts firm. Not the figure of a pregnant woman due to become a mother. Not all the ways that men think of women, as objects of lust, of property, of wombs to fill with their supposed immortality. This was the figure of a woman who had been all those things at one time, but now had value only to herself. Who had finally come to know herself aside from the duties her body could uphold. Who still looked down and saw that body, with all its record of her life. It was not a reflection of the beauty of her body; it was a representation of her self.

That is why they called it the goddess. The men that came later, thousands of years later, who found the figurine and made their names pontificating on its origin and meaning, they assumed a man much like themselves fashioned it. Building upon this assumption of masculine superiority, they reckoned it was a highly significant ceremonial item, meant to confer the favour of fertility upon them—that endless expectation of patriarchal immortality.

But it was not a centrepiece of worship. It was not an offering. It was not a testament to the arts of early “man”. The goddess was a goddess because she was woman, inside and out, born and crafted. She was a woman at the end of her usefulness to men, looking down at herself and pouring her strength into stone. It was a self-portrait.

“I’m partial to the knitting needles. The notion of their soft and manly owner who outfitted all the stray cats was very touching.”

“How very… species-centric of you,” Heleth said.

“Hmph. As if everything you do isn’t about humans.”

“Everything I do is generally about *you*.”

“And right that it is.”

“*Anyway*,” Heleth said pointedly, breathing in and out to the count of five, “I’m trying to see if there’s any sort of pattern. Or theme. Or repeating motif.”

“Those are all the same thing.”

“Shut up, smarmy smarty pants.” Heleth leafed through the pages. After a moment, she tore a blank page out of the back of the notebook without thinking, so that she could jot down summary notes.

“Omigosh!” the notebook screamed; it and the pen had never, ever stopped jabbering at each other, but Heleth had been enormously successful at tuning them out. Until just now. “Why would you even do that? Do I go around tearing *your* bits off?”

“I am so, so sorry,” Heleth said, hurriedly jamming the page back into the book. “I just forgot. That you would know, and just… I’m sorry.”

The notebook let out a sniffle. “After I’ve been so helpful to you. So loyal.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“You could have just asked us, you know,” the pen remarked. If it had arms, Heleth felt certain they would be crossed, based on the tone. “We’ve been here the whole time, hearing and recording the stories, same as you.”

“Better than you,” the notebook confirmed, its voice still thick with injury.

“Well, okay then.” Heleth closed the notebook and placed the pen on top of it, her hand flat over both. “Are there any themes or patterns or motifs?”

“Those are the same things.” This came from Lovelace, the pen, and the notebook in a snarky chorus.

“Great!” Heleth said sharply, so that they would know that she did not, in fact, feel that it was great. “Are there any?”

Rather uneventful Monday. No meetings, so caught up on tasks and emails. Spent most of the day organizing my Playable Comms network contacts in preparation for starting mass contacts. It&#39;s more time-consuming than I thought it&#39;d be, and I&#39;m not certain I love using Evernote for the system (because it&#39;s hard to pull together a mailing list from it), but we&#39;ll see how it goes.

“Just a moment, please,” said the notebook. Heleth thought of the servants on *Downton Abbey* when they were forced to serve someone they thought they were better than. That’s what the notebook sounded like. Like it was having to call the chauffeur “sir”.

“Hmmm, yes, I agree,” it murmured a moment later, and the pen made similar noises of agreement.

“You agree with what? Did I miss something?” Heleth asked.

“Probably,” Lovelace said.

“We think—yes, I believe that’s right—we think,” replied the notebook, still addressing her as a chauffeur, “that you should speak next to a bit of farm equipment.”

“What, like a tractor?”

“Or a harness. Or post-hole digger. Post-driver, fence pliers, feed trough, stocks.” The pen sounded like it could go on forever. “Any number of things would suffice.”

“Are you going to tell me why?”

“We could,” said the notebook, “but we don’t like you very much right now.”

“Oh for crying out loud.”

“I don’t think you’re helping your case much by belittling their feelings,” Lovelace said. Her mouth twitched.

“You—are you *laughing* at me, you horrible cat?”

Lovelace’s tail flicked once, twice, three times. Then she promptly turned her bum, fully exposed, to Heleth and marched happily away. Hopefully toward some farm equipment.

“Laugh it up, fuzzball,” Heleth said, but of course no one got her reference. She was well and truly alone, despite everything in fact being alive.

She groaned as she got to her feet, shaking out the ache in her thighs and bum. She was definitely too old to sit on a hard floor like a little kid. She limped after Lovelace, notebook and pen tucked under her arm.

Three aisles away Lovelace sat, meticulously cleaning her front paws.

“What is it?” Heleth asked, staring at the enormous hunk of metal before her.

Lovelace paused and turned her head sideways to look at the object. Heleth mimicked her.

“Oh. Oh wow.”

Good day again, though less work done. Nice convo with Xin Zhang as we work together on the research seminar series. Then of course a bug came through on YCO2, and I spent 8 hours fixing it. Gah. Anyway, it fixed. I did get to talk to Amy today, and she seems a bit better. Still worried about her and that shitstorm of a uni. Coffee came in from Mom, so that&#39;s awesome. New chickens doing well.

It was certainly the largest object she’d seen so far—so large it didn’t actually fit on the lowest level under the shelf. Rather than stand it in a corner, whoever had placed it here (the Cataloguer, Heleth guessed) had rested it on its side, forever in repose. She’d never considered how big they were; she’d only seen them from afar from a lonely two-lane highway, or in some mid-century drama about oil and ranchers. Well, and on *Smallville*. With her head tilted to the side, she could see it was a windmill. Not one of those old Dutch mills that watched romantically over tulip fields, or one that Quixote foolishly tilted at. Nor one of the modern ones that looked like the lovechild of Boeing and IKEA. No, it was just an ordinary American-style ranch windmill, its blades like a sunflower, its supporting structure a rustic nod to Eiffel.

Heleth held the notebook up. “Is this what you meant?”

“Sure. Why not. Go for it.” The words were monotone, dull, and sullen as a teenager in full Good Charlotte mode.

“I am sorry,” Heleth said again.

“Hmph.”

“Fine.”

Having learned by now to establish comfort from the get-go, Heleth folded her hoodie underneath her bum and sat with notebook and pen on her knee before slowly leaning back against the huge structure. Once her back contacted the metal, the windmill’s voice eased through her.

“Howdy.”

She nearly laughed, but was glad she managed to hold it in. Howdy, indeed. She hadn’t thought anyone really said that unless they’d had a few too many tequilas and had a ten-gallon hat on at a costume party.

“Hello,” she finally replied.

“I had a feeling you’d be stopping by. Have you been enjoying yourself?”

Heleth considered. “I don’t know that ‘enjoying’ is exactly the word I’d use.”

Got some good work done today, despite long Horizon 2020 session I sat in on. It really cemented for me that H2020 is too big a thing to apply for at this stage, so at least that&#39;s done. I worked on networking emails to send to Research Centres, and those go out in the morning. 

Paul and I watched a couple of terrible Christmas romcoms this evening, because he was doing ethics reviews and didn&#39;t want anything he&#39;d have to pay attention to. It was rather fun, actually, as he ranted against all the stupid choices and seemed to enjoy hate-watching them with me. He also reminded me that the day he proposed to me he&#39;d FALLEN THROUGH MY MOTHER&#39;S CEILING, which I had UTTERLY forgotten. I laughed till I peed. It was excellent.

On that note, texted with Stacie today and she told me about a horsetail mug I bought for her 20 years ago, that she still uses every day and thinks of me. I do NOT remember this thing, even though she sent me a pic. I love it.

The windmill laughed. Actually laughed, a deep rumble like corrugated tin shivering. “I don’t imagine it is.” Lovelace stretched along one of its struts, matching its vibration with a smaller one of her own.

“Are you…” Heleth considered for a moment, and then decided the hell with it. “Are you even comfortable here? Lying down like this?”

“It’s not so much the lying down,” it responded. “It’s the being inside. The stillness. The lack of utility. That pen and paper you have? Before you offended them, they were pretty darn excited to get used, weren’t they?”

Heleth glanced down at the still quiet stationery. “They were. Really excited. Again, you two, I’m really sorry.”

They didn’t reply, but their ongoing chatter slowly started back up again. Heleth resumed mentally dialling them back down.

To the windmill Heleth said, “I hadn’t really thought of that. But yeah, every object I’ve talked to has been really helpful. Really eager.”

“You know yet what this place is?”

“I mean, well. It’s a warehouse.”

“Bit of an understatement, don’t you think?”

“Obviously. It’s a big warehouse. A *really* big warehouse full of sentient objects.”

“Okay, okay, you have eyes and ears.” The windmill’s tone waved her off. “But you ain’t quite getting at the why and wherefore.”

Heleth pondered. The whole point of going around and gathering all these stories was expressly to get at the why and wherefore—the origins and purpose of these endless rows of shelves. Despite the tales filling many pages of the notebook, however, she didn’t feel she was much closer to those answers.

“I could tell you,” the windmill carried on, “but then our interaction would be over, and you’d up and leave, and I’d be back where I’ve been for I don’t know how long. Think on it a bit. Forget the stories, forget those patterns you wanted the book to show you. Think on what we all are, and what it means that we’re in this place.”

Heleth stared at the enormous sail blades, the steel struts, the slender pipe drooping down the mill’s middle. Useless. All useless and purposeless, where once they stood tall and turned, greased and functional. She peered at Lovelace.

“Can I ask,” she asked the windmill, “what your purpose was?”

“Water,” the windmill replied. “I pulled water from very deep under the ground. I was the only source of water for nearly ten miles, and I sustained livestock for fifty years. Until…”

The mill stopped. Heleth waited for it to finish the sentence, to finish its story, but only silence fell between them. Finally she said, “I’m very sorry.”

“Hm. Do you know what it is you’re sorry for, girl?”

Of course it asked that question. Couldn’t a woman simply express sympathy for a giant fallen behemoth of agricultural industry without offering an explicit reason?

“She’s sorry for so many things,” Lovelace commented, stretching happily. “And not nearly sorry enough for others.”

“You live the life of a queen. Stop grousing.”

“Grouse sounds nice. I wouldn’t even make you pluck it.”

“Hush.” To the windmill, Heleth made an attempt to respond to its question. “I think I can tell you why I’m sorry. But if I tell you, then doesn’t that end our conversation? I’m not ready to leave just yet. Unless you’re tired of my company?”

“You joke around with an old chunk of metal.”

“I do. Will you tell me your story?”

“You won’t like it.”

Heleth blinked. The stories she’d heard so far had been varied and often hard, but usually very much worth the telling.

“I’d like for you to share it with me anyway.”

This time when the silence fell Heleth knew it was because the mill was gathering strength, collecting the threads of life and memory, spinning them and weaving them into a skein that would convey their true meaning.

“I know you have wondered what made us all the way we are. I know every item in this place has wanted to know what led them to this fate. I think perhaps that I am the only object of the millions here who can pinpoint the moment I shifted.”

“Shifted?” Heleth asked, picturing the windmill, rising tall above a flat and endless prairie, then rumbling across to a new spot like a daddy long-legs marching to a new corner.

“From cold, thoughtless steel to a being who knows that I exist in a world where others exist.”

Heleth gasped. Like a fish dunked suddenly in cold air. “You *remember* becoming sentient?”

“Yes, ma’am. And given the tales that’ve gone around since I been here, I’m thinking mayhap I’m the only one.”

“How come no one told me? I would have come to you straight away!”

“No one knows. I have never told anyone.”

“But…why?”

“I—” the windmill began, but then stopped itself. “Could I have just a moment before we begin?”

“Of course!” Heleth withdrew by scooching forward on her bum, leaning forward.. Likewise, Lovelace rose to her feet from her lounging posture on the strut, but as Heleth watched, the cat stilled. She cocked her head, as if listening.

Then the little tortie said, “I understand,” and settled back down to a more monorail-kitty position. She met Heleth’s eyes and blinked in slow motion.

Heleth said nothing. She began to suspect that telling its tale would be difficult for the massive structure, and getting into a harpy battle with Lovelace would not only be inappropriate, but cruel.

After a few moments, Lovelace called her back, and Heleth rested back against the windmill again.

“It’s a hard story,” the windmill said. “You’re gonna have to excuse me if sometimes I struggle to tell it.”

Heleth murmured her understanding and patience, and waited.

“Like I said, I was a water mill, reaching into the aquifer to pump water supply to hundreds of head of livestock. Usually cattle, sometimes sheep. I don’t remember the man who built me; all that was before I knew anything about anything. What I do remember is the woman who maintained me for thirty years before I wound up here. She was the granddaughter, inheriting the ranch from her dad. I don’t know her name. Not like anyone would ever introduce themselves to a windmill.

“She worked hard. Harder than I did, I know that much. She was out in that pasture every couple of weeks. If she wasn’t greasing or replacing parts, then she was nearby fixing fence or rounding up cattle. She looked older than what she really was. The sun and the wind and the life dried her up, stole all her spark. I don’t have much experience with people, but she always looked like I felt: creaky and rusty and dry-rotted and tired.

“I told you I remembered the moment I shifted, changed from an object with no thought to what I am now. Only it ain’t a moment like you’re thinking, like waking up from a loud noise or a lot of engineering works clicking into place. It was a moment like a storm rolling across the prairie. It can start days before it hits, blowing hot dry winds that make you beg the skies for rain. And then everything gets still, and the flies and the skeeters buzz around like it’s their last hour on Earth. The air presses down on you, and the sky turns green almost. By the time the horizon turns black and starts churning toward you, you’re so ready for that first fat drop of rain you almost cry when it hits you. The thunder rumbles above and below and flashes of lightning circle around until every bit of you feels their crackle and snap. 

“The rain comes, first only a few drops, and then a downpour like god hisself is pouring a bucket over your head. It’s cold and wet, a drink of icy well water after a day of working in the heat and the dust. It rages. Wind and rain and thunder and lightning in a dance that starts angry and wears itself out in a tantrum. It’ll lash itself against you all night, but by morning the skies are washed clear and the soil has had a deep drink and the sun bursts up like it ain’t seen you in a month of Sundays and it’s just so glad you’re here.”

Heleth had never seen such a storm, and the description alone frightened her. She had no idea, however, what it had to do with gaining sentience. Lovelace saw her mouth open to say something to that effect, gave her a hard eyeball, and Heleth shut her trap.

“Well. I guess I miss those old thunderstorms a mite. Wouldn’ta thought it, given how they used to rip bits off me like tearing wet tissue paper, but that’s the way of it, isn’t it? No matter how good or bad home was, you always have a hole in you where it used to be.

“Anyhow, it fits. Only coming to life like this was a storm I didn’t know, and so I couldn’t see it coming till I could look back at it in my memory. Mostly because I now *have* memory. It felt a bit like an awakening, that first realization. She came to check the pump after a particularly blowy gale, and I recognized her. That was it. I knew who she was and what she was coming to do, because I could remember her coming before.

“I never remembered her being that tired, though. Drawn, thin as a blade of grass. I could feel the tremble in her body as she worked. You know that moment, when a bit of metal has been bent back and forth, back and forth, till it’s so fatigued you know one more twist will pop it right in two? That was her on that day. She didn’t break in two, not just yet, but it was only gonna take one more turn and that would be it.

“And it was. I don’t know what did it, ‘cause it wasn’t anywhere near me, but something turned her about and she broke. I don’t even know if she knew it. I’ve sorted through those memories a thousand times, looking for signs and symbols, trying to piece her story together. I just can’t. I only have this one little unravelled thread, and the end. The end is never enough to tell you what the beginning looked like.

“The end was her end, but as you can see, it wasn’t mine. She pulled up that day in that old pickup, just as weary and worn as she was. I could see there was something different. For one, while the pickup was always laden with tools, she didn’t pull a single one out. There wasn’t nothing wrong with me anyway, so it was fine, but nobody makes the effort of climbing a windmill without at least a wrench in their pocket for tightening bolts along the way.

“That’s just what she did, though. Climbed right up, not a tool in sight. Sat on the little platform just under the sails. That was something new, too. She’d never idled before. Always hard-working, always short on time, long on elbow grease. But she stayed there for hours, watching the prairie. It was a frigid cold day, wind whistling right through her, and there’s no warmth three stories up a tangle of steel. She was shivering by the time the sun finally started to sink into its bed, lips blue.

“She watched it all the way down, until the last bands of sunlight faded from the sky, and the stars came out. There wasn’t no moon, and still winter nights out on the prairie leave the air like clear glass. Those stars cut through it, cold and careless. Sometimes I think that’s what did it. That the sun’s warmth was gone, and the moon didn’t come around to offer what little she could. Just those stars, eyes like wolves, like they’d be happy to eat her on up.

“When she finally stood up, she was stiff, her muscles frozen, joints all locked up. Took her a minute. I thought she was getting oiled up for the climb down, but turns out she wasn’t ever planning on that. She walked right to the edge of the platform and off. It shouldn’ta been enough to kill her, that fall, but she let gravity do its business and hit that frozen ground head first.”

Heleth sucked in her breath. The sound was as loud to her as a thunderclap, so she held it in, feeling like her own ability to breathe and move and make noise was somehow irreverent. Even Lovelace fell very still.

The windmill paused for a long moment. If it had lungs, Heleth felt sure it would be taking long, fortifying pulls.

“It was days,” the mill said quietly. “I counted three sunrises before they found her. She didn’t have family. She was the last of them. Only when a friend couldn’t raise her on the phone did anyone go looking, and they finally spotted the pickup. The ranch had been foreclosed. She had nowhere to go, and nothing left to take care of. Instead of being forced into a whole new life she didn’t want, she chose her own way. I ain’t saying it was the right thing to do. Maybe it was just the right thing for her.

“If my becoming what I am now can be boiled down to just one moment, I reckon it’d be than last second before she stepped off the platform. Everything else I’ve told you, it’s what I remember looking back. Like I was there, simmering under the surface, only I didn’t know it yet. She stood up, and I felt her right foot leave the platform, felt her let herself go. I felt the rush of air across my sails as she dropped, that breeze of absence.

“More than that, I felt *her*. Who she was. Who she wanted to be. Who she could have been. That’s when I became aware. And I watched over her until they found her and covered her and took her home.”

Heleth fought against the constriction in her chest. She couldn’t think of a worse way to come into the world, to come into your awareness of yourself in the world, but its tale was full of reverence.

Lovelace, for her part, did her best to soothe the enormous structure with a purr that projected across the entire warehouse.

When she felt she could speak without bursting into white woman tears, Heleth said, “So what do you believe happened? Why do all of you have sentience, why are you here?”

“I’m gonna guess you have a catch-all in your house. A drawer, a shed, something that don’t have no kind of clear purpose or designation other than to hold a whole lot of things that don’t have no clear purpose. Yet.”

“The junk drawer, sure.”

“And every item in there seems like it might be useful. At some point. Some day. Too useful—potentially useful—to throw away, but not purposeful enough to have their own place in the world.”

“Sounds logical.”

“Well, that’s how I see this place. We were all useful once. We might be again. Until then, here we are.”

Heleth chewed on that. “But that doesn’t explain the sentience.”

“I don’t think it can really be explained, not the way you’re hoping, with hard facts and certainty. What I can draw from the stories I’ve heard, and from my own experience, is this: every object in this here place got imbued with just a little bit of humanity. Most got it in itty bitty little doses, but over a very long stretch of time. They had a consistent presence with or near one human being who went through some pretty deep emotional stuff. It just seeped into them, like drops of oil into dirt.

“Me, I’m one of the few what got it like a switch turning on. No consistent presence, no long drawn-out tale, just one moment where that human soul just couldn’t contain itself one second longer. It burst out, and some of it lingered. When it didn’t have nowhere else to go, it stuck itself to the nearest empty vessel.”

Heleth looked around at the thousands of objects that were in her field of vision, and imagined the millions more stretching across the endless tiers of shelves. “That sounds almost like a haunting. Like you’re all haunted.”

“Yep, that’s what I reckon. Not haunted the way it is in stories, with full ghosts who remember who they used to be and carry on just like they was living. But haunted just the same.”

“And you get collected here because you’re… I don’t—I’m not sure I see.”

In your world, humans have souls, or sentience, or self-awareness, however you want to call it. Some animals, too. But not gems or furniture or notepads or windmills. For all us objects to be what we are, to know ourselves, to be able to talk to one another, to share memories, to talk to you, well, that breaks the foundations. We can’t exist in that world and have it keep ticking along, you ken? So by whatever means, on purpose or on some kind of universal filter, soon’s we break into being, we get put here.”

“But that’s… that’s *horrible*.” She felt tears welling up in her eyes. “It’s cruel.”

“It’s only cruel if you think it’s done on purpose,” the windmill replied.

“The Cataloguer.”

“Mayhap not even the Cataloguer. Listing and organizing ain’t necessarily the same thing as taking.”

Heleth leaned her head down, lightly resting it on Lovelace’s soft fur. The cat allowed the liberty. “Even so. If there is a Cataloguer, it means they just stand by and index you while you lie here in torture until when? Can you die? Are you just here, alive but stuck, for all of eternity?”

“Looks like, so far.”

“Well then, if there is a Cataloguer, they’re a bastard. They should free you.”

29 Nov 2020
Goodish Sunday. Got up, had breakfast, read for a bit, then got to my chores. Cleaned chickens, shifted Jake&#39;s poop to a pile for composting, then dug the road drainage trench out again, this time to put a pipe in so I won&#39;t have to do it again. Dig, put leftover road liner in, pipe, then cover with leftover road slate. By the end my knee went (probably a muscle strain), so I had to message Paul out with my crutches to help me put stuff away. Jake was limping again, so got Paul to help me put his boot on to see if that helps. Dang horse.

Semi-hot bath, dinner, and The Mandalorian. Gosh, that&#39;s good stuff.

“Can’t say as I disagree with that sentiment.”

Lovelace licked the small hairs at Heleth’s hairline, occasionally spitting as she accidentally caught a long one. Heleth appreciated the affection, though she thought it was more likely that Lovelace was offended by her human juice.

To the windmill she said, “Is there anything I can do?”

With a tone that said it would have sighed had it had lungs, the windmill replied, “I’ve thought a lot about that question, ever since I heard the rumors that you were coming around. Do I ask you to burn the place down?”

“Oh, gosh, I don’t think I could. That would be killing all of you.”

“It would. But it might be the only mercy any of us ever get.”

“I hear you. There’s also the fact that, well, Lovelace and I don’t know how to get out of here yet. We haven’t found our doorway yet.”

“She told me. So I know destroying the warehouse isn’t a possibility for you, at least not yet.”

Heleth eyed Lovelace. The cat was having private convos now, apparently. She had no idea why she was surprised; it was just that Heleth didn’t much like being left out of things. “What are my other options?”

“Find the Cataloguer. If anyone is going to know more than us objects do, it’ll be them.”

“I can try. I have no idea where to start, but I can try.”

“I imagine if you can find an office, that’s where they’ll be. And if they’re not, wait a bit and they’re bound to come back.”

Heleth agreed, thanked the windmill profusely for its story, and for the first time in what felt like days, sat forward and broke the connection.

Lovelace stayed a moment longer, which Heleth guessed meant she was having her own private words with the mill, then bounded down from the structure.

Monday. Fairly bog standard. Went through email, went to a coffee chat online. Made a research friend (anthropology! evolution! narrative! spec fic!). Chill evening. Oh, Paul has a sore throat and a cough, so he went for his 3rd Covid test. He&#39;s more responsible than I am. I would have ignored it.

Heleth and Lovelace walked aimlessly for a moment, both lost in thought. At the junction of several aisles, however, Heleth stopped.

“Do you know where we’re going?” she asked the cat.

“I was following you.”

“Since when do you follow me?”

“Since I don’t know where we’re going.”

“Did you know Abbott and Costello?”

“Who are they?”

“No, who’s on first.”

Rather than carrying the bit further, Lovelace blinked once, then sat and began licking her butt.

“Fair enough,” Heleth muttered. “Listen, the mill was right. There has to be an office. A desk. Paperwork. Heck—even just a spot where a label-maker lives. All these shelves have nicely printed labels. Someone does that.”

“The Cataloguer,” Lovelace said without pausing.

“The Cataloguer,” Heleth confirmed. “So where’s the most logical place for that to be?”

“Depends.”

“On?”

“Is the Cataloguer human?” Finally, Lovelace released her body into a more publicly appropriate position. She sat staring into the distance, as if she could see something utterly invisible to Heleth. “What kind of transport do they have? Or do they have wings, or teleportation? That’s a big space to move around in. Do they have a camper van, and are just on the move all the time?”

“That would make our lives super difficult.”

“Yes.”

“Let’s start with the easiest assumptions: we haven’t seen evidence of the Cataloguer, and neither did any of the objects we talked to. So I don’t think they move around a lot, much less in a camper van.”

“Assumption accepted.”

“Which means there’s a stationary location somewhere.”

“Perhaps. Doesn’t mean it’s even in this dimension.”

Heleth dropped her forehead to the side of the nearest shelf. “Again, Lovelace, we have to go with some parameters we can actually investigate.”

Lovelace’s whiskers twitch on one side, the kitty equivalent of “Fine, whatever.”

Lovelace pinned her ears back and zoomed ahead.

“Well, at least I have some peace for a few minutes,” Heleth muttered. She trudged on at a normal bipedal pace, feeling a bit put out that her ancestors developed thumbs instead of just going for another set of arms.

She had to rest twice along the way to the next corner, and each time awoke with Lovelace snuggled into the curve between her ribs and hip.

The next corner, when they reached it, was again empty. Heleth considered sitting down and crying. She wasn’t hungry—part of the apparent illogic of the warehouse was that she didn’t have the typical biological urges. No hunger, no thirst, no need to pee or anything. She even theorized that the drive to sleep was more that she really loved sleeping, and her brain needed to regroup more than her body needed actual rest.

Nonetheless, she *missed* food. She missed coffee, and the way it smelled and that first sip and how it warmed her and made her brain tingle. She missed beautiful runny fried egg yolks soaking into sourdough toast, and chocolate chip cookies, and mediocre pizza. Every so often her mind would drift to the tacos she and Lovelace had shared in Mexico, and her stomach whines. She is so very done with this warehouse.

“Fifty-fifty shot now, Lovey,” Heleth says to the cat as they move off less than enthusiastically toward the third corner.

“No,” Lovelace replied. “Have you truly never heard of the Monty Hall problem?”

“Yes I have,” Heleth said, loudly and forcefully, trying to prevent Lovelace from explaining it to her. “But I never understand it, and I never will, so just save your breath and let me have this, okay?”

“Your inability to understand fundamental probability astounds me.”

“I’m sure it’s not the only thing about me that astounds you.”

“True,” Lovelace concedes. “There are quite a lot of surprising things about you, not the least of which is your persistent ignorance.”

“That’s funny. ‘Persistent ignorance’ was my nickname in school.”

They walked on for what seemed like hours before something occurred to Heleth. “Hey,” she said, “how is it *you* know about the Monty Hall problem?”

“Doesn’t everyone?”

“No. Not even remotely. I barely know it. I definitely don’t know who Monty Hall is. But the reason we humans might learn about it is school. Cats don’t go to school.”

“Some do.” Lovelace trotted along easily, her tail curled into a question mark, ears pricked. “We’re cats. If we walk into a classroom and sit at a desk, is anyone really going to stop us?”

Heleth thought of all the funny cat pics she’d ever seen on the internet. “Well, no.”

“There you go.”

“But I’ve had you since you were a kitten. I know you didn’t go to school.”

“You don’t know my life.”

Heleth rubbed her face, unsure if it was numb from exhaustion or frustration. “I do, actually. What part of your lazy-ass life don’t I know?”

“The part where I know the Monty Hall problem and you don’t.”

Heleth screamed. She just full on sucked in as much air as she could and let it out as long and loud as she could stand it. Which wasn’t very long, actually, since her voice wasn’t used to such strenuous exercise. She broke into a hacking cough after only a few seconds.

Lovelace took the opportunity to sit on her haunches and clean her belly. “Oh, fine,” she said. “It was on Brooklyn 99. Amy Santiago explained it. Neither you nor anyone else understood it, but of course I did.”

The coughing turned into a laughing fit. She couldn’t help it. Heleth doubled over, laughing so hard she couldn’t breathe, alternately wheezing and snorting. Though she hadn’t felt the need to pee in days (as well as she could measure them in there), her fit of absurdity forced a few drops out.

Once she could breathe again, she resumed her trudging, leaving Lovelace behind for once. And whether the next corner had a fifty-fifty shot or not, it yielded success.

“Lovelace! I see something!”

Heleth wasn’t quite able to force herself into a run, but she managed a quicker shuffle. Lovelace, who could easily have beaten her to the spot, hung back and let Heleth have a little win.

When they arrived, they indeed found an office. It wasn’t much. A couple of thin partitions made a rectangle in the corner, with a few more laid on top for a rough ceiling. Inside was perhaps the saddest thing Heleth had seen thus far: a desk fashioned from two sawhorses and a strip of plywood, and a camping cot. On one side of the desk sat a kettle and tea-making supplies, and on the other spares for a label maker. The label maker itself was nowhere to be seen.

“Hello?” Heleth called out. No matter how much she called, however, no one answered.

Lovelace hopped up onto the plywood desk and sniffed around. “Not alive,” she commented.

“I guess that makes sense. Wouldn’t want to be talked at all the time you were trying to work.”

The little tortie continued her explorations, but there wasn’t that much for her to poke her whiskers into. After a few minutes, she curled up on the cot, took a few cursory licks at her fur, and settled in for a nap.

“Now what?” Heleth muttered, looking around. Her eye caught something outside the makeshift room. “Oh, duh,” she said.

This corner of the warehouse, like every other, housed towering shelves. Towering shelves full of sentient objects, all within full sight and sound of the office. All she needed to do was talk to the nearest items.

“Nope,” said the armchair she sunk into first. “Never seen nobody there.”

“You’d think we’da seen the Cataloguer for sure, being where we are,” commented a small jewelry box. “It’s not like we sleep.”

“I wish I could see them,” a teddy bear told her. “I wish I could talk to them and tell them what a shithead they are. I mean, whoever they are, they just *put* us here and left us.”

Heleth gave a surprised snort at the cursing coming from the child’s toy. But she couldn’t blame it, really. It wasn’t the first time she’d heard that sentiment.

After hearing the same thing, over and over, from every nearby item, she wearily retreated to the cot in the office. She sat on it like a sofa, leaning back against the wall. Lovelace gave a mild grunt of protest; in response, Heleth wedged her hand underneath the little cat. She loved the soft warmth of cat belly, and it never hurt to pretend that the cat had simply happened upon her hand resting there, loving her so much she couldn’t resist curling up around it. That had never happened, of course.

“I just don’t get it, Lovelace. Every item has a label. Every shelf has a classification. We can clearly see that someone is here. Maybe lives here? Surely not. Maybe is just here enough to need tea and a nap from time to time. But how could none of the items have ever seen them?”

“It’s truly an enigma,” Lovelace said.

“Don’t be so smarmy,” Heleth told her. “You still haven’t found a doorway out. I think one won’t appear till we figure this out.”

“You’ve talked to too many of these nutters.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

Lovelace kicked at her hand with those disembowelling hind legs. “‘The door won’t appear till we solve the mystery.’ What a bunch of superstitious nonsense. As though we have a Cataloguer of our own.”

Routine Sunday. Paul went and got Thomas, the 1st year American student whose mom is a friend of Kiwi Karen&#39;s. They put in some slate stone paths for me out in the stableyard. Kid was going a bit nuts in isolation in halls. So we did our good deed. Picked up two more chickens, which brings us to 7—Fresh Start for Hens wound up with 80 extra from the farmer, so Catrin called me to see if I could take more. Then just more work on the hallways. Never ending!

Heleth examined her hand; only a few beads of blood from Lovelace’s ire. “How do you know we don’t have a Cataloguer?”

Lovelace tucked her head under herself. “Because I refuse to cede control of my life to some magical figure in the sky. If you want to believe that you are some fickle god’s puppet, you go right ahead. But you leave me out of it.”

“What, you’re so convinced you’re a god that you can’t handle the thought that anyone else might be?” Heleth poked at her, but Lovelace wasn’t taking the bait.

“Just because you treat me like a god doesn’t mean I actually believe it. It’s just that cats are clearly a superior species.”

“Oh, bollocks.”

“We are. I don’t make the rules.”

The idea of god—or gods—wasn’t one Heleth had ever spent much energy thinking about. Either gods existed, in which case she figured *all* gods existed, because otherwise which one did you pick? or none did. In which case who cared? She’d attended services as a child, as that was what everyone did, but most of her memory was of being bored and scolded. It hadn’t endeared her much to the practice. But she’d liked the singing, and the stories that weren’t terrifying.

She considered her current predicament. It had been a while since she really thought about it. It was still highly possible—probable?— that she was concussed and all this was a remarkably lucid fever dream. Much like gods, however, it didn’t matter anymore whether or not this was the case. If she was unconscious, there wasn’t much she could do about it. If she wasn’t, however, and all this was actually real, she might as well keep trying to move on down the virtual road.

Only she wasn’t sure what she was moving toward. Home? The same empty apartment, the same pandemic, the same gig economy that left everyone slaving and in debt? If some godlike creature had put her in this situation for laughs, then she was a rat in a maze, and she was a really fucking *lost* rat in a maze.

Monday. Jake doesn&#39;t have enough hoof on one side to nail into, so he&#39;s still barefoot till some glue can come in. He&#39;s ouchy on it, but that&#39;s not surprising. Also, the new chickens are a HANDFUL. Sharon is a beast, even having a go at Newt through the mesh, and Donnova was bloody when I went out to shut everyone in, sprays everywhere. Think Sharon might have pulled a blood feather. I hope she makes it. That dang Sharon is a velociraptor.

Otherwise, good day going through some of the New Media Writing Prize entries.

And that brought up a thought that had never before occurred to her: what if she *didn’t* go back? What if she stayed in the maze? Well, not this maze. There was really no place for a living, breathing sentient creature in this warehouse. She was pretty sure it was some sort of dumping ground for unnatural items. Items that shouldn’t exist, and that no one knew what to do with.

Was that why she was here? Was she a sentient object no one knew what to do with? As she pondered that question, she sunk down further on the cot, lower and lower. With nothing better to do, and absolutely no mercy for her continued mental health, her brain flooded her with memories of school.

She hadn’t been bad at school. She hadn’t been good at school. She was neither an athlete, nor popular, nor goth, nor pretty, nor a loser. She hadn’t been bullied, and she hadn’t bullied anyone. She’d had a couple of friends, but no one she kept up with as an adult, apart from the typical social media curiosity connection.

She’d been no one, not really. She’d watched a YouTube video once from an ex-spy who said the Sean Connerys and Daniel Craigs of the world would actually make shitty spies: they stood out too much, attracted too much attention. And very few people had the talent of a Mr. Ripley or a Gary Oldman. The people who made the best spies were the gray people. The average people. The ones who were neither tall nor short, neither ugly nor attractive. Nondescript, common, unremarkable.

Embarrassingly, she’d had a good cry after watching that short vid. She knew she was exactly what that woman had been describing. A no one, noticed by no one. Only she didn’t even have the excitement—the adventure, the purpose—of secret missions and covert identities. She couldn’t even pretend that her dull ordinariness had any effect on the world apart from adding one more chubby, middle-aged cat lady to someday fill a cemetery plot.

Good work day today. I&#39;m sure I got something done. Maybe?

Donnova the chicken is not doing well. I&#39;ve got her in the sunroom in a box for warmth, but I imagine she&#39;ll be dead by morning. Sigh. It was funny to name chickens after my friends, but not so much now.

Oh! The first covid vaccines in the UK were given today. A woman named Margaret Keenan was the first. The second was William Shakespeare. Doesn&#39;t get much more British than that.

R: Kate Stuart&#39;s Shifting Sands; A Memory Called Empire. W: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
Most of her memories of school were a blur. She remembered a teacher once told her it was too bad she was white; she’d have more opportunities were she a minority, according to this warped view on the world. She remembered a phys ed teacher who said she might have a talent at square dancing, but she’d have to care about it first. She remembered a classmate named Heather, who upon meeting her was very excited to have a “name twin”, then, disappointed at Heleth’s actual name, never acknowledged her presence again. 

So it made sense that she was stuck here in this sad little room, in a gargantuan warehouse full of lost and innocuous things. She wasn’t entirely certain she was lost, per se, but she had no doubt she was innocuous. She said as much to Lovelace.

“Speak for yourself,” Lovelace replied. “For your theory to be accurate, I would also have to be lost and drab, and I am neither.”

Heleth inoffensively stroked the cat’s fur. “You could be collateral damage.”

“No.”

“Why not?”

Lovelace sighed, resigned to being pulled into a conversation rather than a lengthy, warm, and uninterrupted nap. She unpretzeled herself, taking a loaf position. “In case you hadn’t noticed, I am a cat.”

“Shocker.” When Lovelace did not elaborate, Heleth prompted her. “Come on. You know you’re dying to tell me, you smarmy git.”

“Cats are special.”

“Yes, and?”

“We don’t follow your rules.”

“Yes, and?”

“We aren’t subject to your consequences.”

Heleth was tempted to keep throwing in “yes, and”s, but held back out of respect for Lovelace’s teeth and claws. “Are you going to unpack this for me or not?”

Apparently, this required yet another shift in position. Lovelace cascaded off the cot and then reversed direction up to the desktop. She sat, facing Heleth, her tail neatly curled around herself.

“You humans find it very funny to joke about cats. That dogs have owners but cats have staff. That petting and feeding and loving a dog makes the dog think you are a god; that doing the same to a cat makes the *cat* think it’s a god. Et cetera.”

Heleth snortled.

Up and down Wednesday. Up early to do a work meeting. Heat pump guy came to do an estimate. Paul opened his gift from Amy and Sam (that arrived addressed to me) before I could even get down the stairs. Lost the chicken - partial necropsy (fancy word for &quot;I cut it open) showed crop impaction. Buried chicken. Moose is trembling, maybe hypoglycemia, so I worried and called vet. Our favorite vet Dr. Hobbit has retired, which is very sad for us, so elsewhere tomorrow. Went in circles on web hosting with the uni, and got rather frustrated. Then Paul kept snapping at me over every little thing, and I lost it there, too. Just done with him giving everything to Bangor and nothing to himself. That shithole doesn&#39;t deserve any bit of it.

Anyway, had a hard time getting started tonight, and I want to go to bed.

“Yes, I’m sure you think it’s very funny. Like *The Flintstones*.” Lovelace’s left ear tipped to the side and her eyes narrowed, a feline eye roll. “What you never consider is that you didn’t domesticate cats.”

“No?”

“We conquered you.”

Despite her despair, Heleth burst out in an incredulous guffaw. “A little army of housecats, eh?”

“Laugh it up, pinkie.” The tip of Lovelace’s tail curled, snapped the desktop. Curled, snapped the desktop. Curled, snapped. “The more astute among you like to say that cats domesticated ourselves. That as your species progressed to agrarian civilizations we moved into the granaries and hunted the mice that hunted your food. That we developed a cry at the same frequency as your own offspring to inspire you to care for us. That we evolved our purr to soothe you, to entice you to continue doing whatever it is that gives us pleasure.”

Heleth blinked. “You don’t meow just to humans.”

“Kittens call to their mother. Adults meow to manipulate you.”

“You screm at me all the time.”

“Yes.”

A pause while Heleth chewed on this. “Other cats purr.”

“Small cats.”

“Yeah…?”

Lovelace tilted her head to the side. When Heleth clearly didn’t get it, she said flatly, “Small cats are who conquered you. We are all of familial descent.”

This all felt ridiculously silly to Heleth. Mad Hatter silly. Laughing gas silly. Clown nose absurd. But the longer she stared at Lovelace, the less of a counterargument she could form. Huffing, she flopped on the cot, an arm folded behind her head, staring upward at the slapdash ceiling.

“Why?” she asked. “Why ‘conquer’ us?”

“Why not?”

“Come on.”

“Look at us. Look at your life, and then look at my life. Who won?”

The arm behind Heleth’s head comes round and covers her eyes as she tries to hold in a wail. “Goddammit. Why can’t you ever tell me things that make me feel *better*? I can’t believe I ever wished my pets could talk.”

Well, it was a day. Up at stupid o&#39;clock to take Moose to the vet (he&#39;s fine, and I&#39;m officially a helicopter mom). Was making coffee and Paul distracted me with a video of a porn guy pronning himself up with a HAM SANDWICH. Mustard and mayo on his junk, cheese slices on his nipples, e&#39;rthang. When I finally tore myself away, I pressed down on the aeropress and exploded coffee everywhere because I hadn&#39;t tightened the filter on. Scalded my hand pretty good. Took Moose, came back, got a little work in and then Mon came to fix Jake up. Jake not happy about being in at all, but at least he&#39;s back to his field now.

“I’ve always been able to talk,” Lovelace informed her. “You just haven’t been able to understand.”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.”

Lovelace quieted, leaving Heleth to contemplate humanity’s false ascendancy to the top of the animal kingdom. She shouldn’t be so surprised. She herself much preferred cats to humans.

She hadn’t even realized she’d fallen asleep before she was awoken by a strange noise. Perhaps the relative mindlessness and lifelessness of this room compared to the warehouse outside offered a quality of silence she hadn’t experienced for many days, for she drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep. She’d almost forgotten what it was like to sleep on a piece of furniture that couldn’t speak to you.

But that noise, soft as it was, was enough to break the spell. She rose to consciousness without opening her eyes. The small room felt less empty, as though some of the air had been displaced.

“Who are you?”

Well, that ended the mystery anyway. Heleth blinked alive and scrambled up to her feet. Only once she’d managed to un-upend herself and stagger upright was she able to take in the intruder.

Except, of course, she was the intruder.

The label-maker in its hand marked it as the Cataloguer, whether or not it was aware of the moniker. Nothing else about the being, however, was as Heleth had expected.

“Holy shitfire.”

Lovelace, who’d been curled into a capital Q on the desktop, padded over and sniffed at the creature. Whatever data that gave her, she didn’t seem to be impressed one direction or the other. She sat back down and proceeded to clean herself, sections 45 and 48.

“I’ll ask again. Who are you and what are you doing here?”

“I’m Heleth. I’m…” What to explain? How far to go back? “I guess I’m just looking for the Cataloguer.”

Slept in nicely today. Paul went in to work, so house was rather quiet. Had to get up to transfer wonderbox domain to new VPS server, then walk Newt and visit the critters.

“Cataloguer?”

“You, I think.”

For a very long moment, Heleth and the Cataloguer, if indeed that’s what it was, stared at each other. It. Heleth could only think to use the inanimate pronoun, though at some point she thought it surely had had a gendered pronoun — even third gender.

Because before her was a completely clean, bleached, articulated human skeleton. It had no muscles, no meat, no gristle, yet it moved around and spoke to her without the need for touch. Heleth considered her very recent past and wondered if she’d encountered some hallucinogens. Of all the improbable things she’d seen and heard in this place, this was the most.

She couldn’t tell if the bones were male or female, black or white, young or old. She wanted to think if she had a few more minutes to ponder she could make an educated guess based on all those forensic mystery novels and episodes of *Bones* she’d watched, but in the end she was lucky if she could spell zygomatic arch, much less determine whether it was prominent or not.

“Are you—” Heleth hesitated, not wanting to offend, but treading absolutely new ground. “Are you like all the objects out there?”

The skull pulled back a little, and Heleth didn’t need to see facial muscles to understand that she had, despite her intentions, offended it.

“If you mean am I sentient,” the skull deadpanned, “then yes, yes I am. I don’t think a pile of calcium on its own could stand here and speak to you.”

“Much less threaten me with a label-maker,” Heleth said. “Heh. Heh.”

The skeleton noticed the completely nonthreatening label-maker in its hand and laid it carefully on the desk. “I’m not the one squatting in someone else’s personal space.”

Heleth held up her hands in a joint gesture of “mea culpa” and “slow down”. “I get it,” she said, slowly standing up from the cot. “Maybe we should start over. I’m Heleth. I’m looking for someone the objects call the Cataloguer. Are you the Cataloguer?”

The skeleton folded its arm bones over its rib bones. “My name is Quyen.”

“You have a name?” Heleth shook her head. “Sorry, sorry, that was rude. It’s just nothing else in here has had a name.”

“I’m not like anything else in here.”

“Fair enough.”

A silence fell as the skeleton—Quyen—simply stared at her. At least Heleth thought it was staring. It was difficult to tell with no eyeballs. Heleth flicked a glance to Lovelace to see if the cat had any ideas, but Lovelace was still contentedly cleaning herself.

“So, um,” Heleth ventured, “I’ve been collecting, sort of, a lot of stories from the objects in the warehouse.” She held up her notebook, as though that made it clearer. “Would you, I mean, do you have a story? That you want to share?”

Quyen didn’t move for several moments. Heleth started to wonder if she wasn’t in some kind of danger after all.

Then the skeleton sighed, dropped its arms, and circled the desk to sit behind it. It waved an arm at the cot, a curt invitation for Heleth to sit back down. Heleth slowly settled back down, and Quyen placed its phalanges atop its femurs.

“It’s a very long story,” Quyen said. “Or very short. I died. I became an object. I regained sentience. I wound up here, like every other inanimate object with the exact same story.”

“Not the exact same story,” Heleth countered. “Nothing else in here was human first. Nothing else here was sentient first, with memories and experiences and love and emotions. Do you still have your memories?”

“From being alive the first time?”

Heleth nodded.

Quyen’s eyes, if it had had them, would have been on the desktop. Or perhaps on Lovelace, who had finally settled into a loaf position, purring. “I have fragments. I remember being a young girl, walking barefoot through a stream. I remember a woman, I think she was my mother, in a rice paddy. I remember cooking over an open fire, and exchanging glances with a young man. You see, fragments.”

“You said your story was very long.”

“I remember only fragments of my human life,” Quyen told her. “My memories as a skeleton are clearer.

“As a human, I believe I died in middle age. I do not know exactly what middle age for my era and location was; I could have been thirty or sixty years old. I was poor, and so my funeral rites were simple, and I was buried in a grave near my family’s home. But I did not stay in it forever. We did not embalm or preserve our bodies then, so our bodies decayed quickly. We believed that our souls moved on to their next lives, and our bodies were only… you might call them vehicles. Temporary housing. What mattered to us was only that our souls were safe during the transfer.”

Heleth took a moment to interrupt. “And was it? Your soul, I mean? Safe during the transfer?”

Quyen gave a bony shrug. “I am only the physical remains. I do not know what happened to my human soul after my death. I hope that, as we believe, it moved on to its next life. But I have seen many strange things since, and heard many stranger stories. For all that I know, souls are nothing more than fairy tales. For all that I know, my soul has lived a thousand lives since mine.”

Heleth sat back, dissatisfied, but willing to let the tale continue to unfold. 

“Times moved on, and my family’s farm came to have more value as building sites than for growing food. My ancestors, my descendants, and I were all dug up to create the foundations for what would become a city. I do not know if it became a city immediately. Perhaps it was first a fort, or a hospital, or rice storage, or a factory. Whatever it was, it was a rice paddy no longer, and the long story of my family was wiped from the land.

I clearly didn&#39;t feel well last night, and didn&#39;t much today either. Cramps. This stupid uterus is clearly going to torture me until the end of the pandemic. Gah.

Managed to do some work today, once I could get past the pain and nausea and mild dizziness.

“I never saw my family’s farm again, nor the country where I was born. You would think that kind, moral people would see all of us reburied, once they had determined that our resting places must be disturbed. That they would move us to a site where our descendants could continue to honor us, or at the very least, where we could have the basic human respect of consecrated burial.

“They did not, however, move us to a new place to rest. Instead, it seems their decisions were made by greed and nothing else. The bones that they dug up were sold. We were sold to be marionettes, to be mixed with bones of animals and fashioned into chimeras for sideshow amusements. We were sold to be ground up and further sold as snake oil, as powdered rhinoceros horn and shark cartilage and tiger organs, so that weak men could consume us and feel more powerful. Perhaps it is an amusing irony that such pathetic men consumed the bones of old women and felt themselves powerful. Perhaps it is only a little known truth.

“As you can see, I was neither made unnatural nor ground up for questionable magics. No, it seems my bones—” here she held up her hands, as if displaying them for a jewelry commercial “—were very uniform, without undue damage or disease. They were sold to a burgeoning medical institute, to be used to teach young men about the structure of the human body.”

Quyen placed her hands back in her lap, as it were.

Heleth ventured, “At least your skeleton had a good purpose, in the end? Teaching doctors how to heal people?”

The skull’s lower mandible hinged in a bitter laugh. “I tried very hard to convince myself of that. That somewhere in those halls was a boy who understood that I had once been human, just like him, and that my presence there was an honor. I tried to ignore the disgusting manner in which I was obtained, and focus on the knowledge I could help develop. But they made it very, very hard.

Goodish day. Jake galloped in, but then when I took the makeshift boot off he decided he was crippled again, so rebandaged him. Finally got to have cleaner back in for first time in 9 months! My house is CLEEEEEEAAAAAN!!!!! So nice. Escape room launched, and went well.

“For many years, it was as you say: I was honored as a teaching tool, if not really as a former human being. I was stored neatly out of the way, out of danger when I wasn’t being used. When I was on display, I was handled with gloves, and attention was given to my joins and pins. Remember, it was very difficult for medical schools to obtain human remains for teaching. Many religions forbid it, and no one could stand the thought of their loved ones being poked and prodded by these blasphemers for all to see. So full skeletons like me—and cadavers and the like—were rare, and usually illegal. We were paupers dug from unmarked graves, or foreigners, or hated relations. Even if we were loved in life, we were cast out in death.”

“Oh, I read about these two guys in Scotland,” Heleth said. “Burt and Hare? Something like that? Hundreds of years ago, maybe when you’re talking about, they didn’t just rob graves. They went ahead and killed people who wouldn’t be missed, homeless, solo travelers, that kind of thing. Then sold them to the anatomy labs.”

“Sounds enterprising to me,” Lovelace said. “You humans kill everything that moves, but you get so squeamish over your own dead.”

Quyen started, staring at the cat. “The cat talks?”

Lovelace turned a narrowed eye to her. “The skeleton walks?”

Heleth just shrugged. “It’s hard to find something in this place that doesn’t talk.”

The skeleton edged minutely away from the little tortie, and carried on. “By this time, any reverence the doctors and future doctors felt about the human remains they learned from was gone. Once we were dead, we were no longer human. We were just flesh to cut, bones to break apart and piece back together. They delighted in it. They became drunken with their power, their ability to peel back flesh, to dig inside a body and rummage through it. It was as though they believed that, in order to heal live bodies, they must somehow reduce them to parts, separate them from the souls within. They worked on machines, not people. And therefore they gave no thought to harming people, as long as the machines kept ticking along.”

Good day today, though I feel like I didn&#39;t do much. Jake sort of doing better - at least now I know it&#39;s definitely the splits on his heels. If I can get those to heal, he&#39;ll be fine (that&#39;s a lot of heel homonyms). Chickens are still mad at me, so gotta get those nets up. Did Levi&#39;s mock viva this evening, and he did great. I&#39;m not worried about him at all.

A memory resurfaced in Heleth’s mind. A year after her divorce, a year after hibernating in her studio apartment with chocolate milk and pizza, she’d finally gotten a whiff of energy to go to the doctor about her ongoing and insurmountable depression. She hadn’t had a job—her half of the sale of their house and a generous settlement from her ex had seen her through the year—and had hardly had any human contact in all that time. She’d finally recognized her need to be pulled out of the deep, dark pit she’d sunk into. She clearly wasn’t gaining any traction on her own, and she had no one to throw her a rope. Her best hope was, unfortunately, the medical establishment.

She’d managed clean clothes on the day of her appointment, but that was as far as her spoons had stretched. She hadn’t managed a shower, but had spritzed some dry shampoo on her grease-mop scalp and put her hair up, hoping its filth wouldn’t be too obvious. She’d been forced through the rituals of blood pressure measurements, temperature, and as always, the dreaded weigh-in. She hadn’t looked at the number. She never looked at the number. Not since the fourth grade, when puberty had hit her earlier than all the other girls, and she’d gone plump and soft and round while they were all still stringy and flat and androgynous.

She was already painfully exhausted by the time the doctor came into the exam room. Her back ached from the unfamiliar chairs, and her feet hurt from the hard, easily cleaned linoleum. Her hands had picked up a tremor, and she had to let her eyelids droop to protect her eyes from the glare of the overhead fluorescents. The clack of the heavy door as it opened and shut, the doctor’s initial bright and forcefully cheery hello all stabbed into her head, toothpicks being driven into her eardrums with each noise above a whisper.

She’d had difficulty expressing her symptoms. It felt like the words were at the bottom of a well, deep inside her, and she had to drag them up with a long, heavy, wet rope one at a time. Assembling them into sentences was almost impossible, as the words slipped back into the well as soon as she turned to haul up another. She couldn’t look at the doctor. Speaking exhausted her lungs, for she had to lift the anvil off her chest every time she inhaled to eke out another phrase.

Floaters popped in and out of her vision as she tumbled through her explanation, and her skull began to throb. The doctor nodded and made “mm-hmm” noises, but jotted no notes. She looked once at Heleth’s record.

Heleth was midway through a sentence—“so I think I need a little help digging myself out of the pit of despair”—when the doctor interrupted.

“Tell me, how many times a week do you exercise?”

Heleth blinked, the change of topic blanking her slate entirely. “Exercise?” she repeated numbly.

“Sure. Walking, swimming, dancing, cycling, running. Getting sweaty, getting your heart rate up.”

“Not much at the moment,” Heleth admitted, feeling shame seep through her. It was remarkable, really, that another layer of negative emotion could soak through the fabric of her already sodden cocoon of depression, but it did, quick as ink on tissue. She felt that anvil settle back on her chest. “I’m so tired all the time.”

“I bet you are! You need to get those endorphins going. What’s your diet like?”

Another hairpin curve, and Heleth slowly began to catch up. “I eat,” she said, and this time she didn’t much regret how sullen her voice sounded.

“What, like sodas and chips? They’re just dragging you down, you know. Obesity is quite an epidemic these days, and it leaves you open to all kinds of other diseases. Your BMI is quite high, and that can lead to Type II diabetes and congestive heart failure if you don’t do something about it.”

Heleth closed her eyes all the way then. “I understand, but I can’t do those things till I can get out of bed.”

“You got out of bed today! I bet you do it every day.”

*No I fucking don’t*, Heleth thought, and felt her heart rate skyrocket. Did that count as exercise? “Please,” she said. “I know I need to get healthier, but that’s why I’m here.”

The doctor scribbled something on a prescription pad with a flourish, tore off the little square, and handed it to her. “There. That’s all you need. I know you can do it.” And then she left the exam room, her ponytail swinging.

Heleth looked down at the slip in her hand, hoping that even if the chirpy doc had been myopic in her patter, she had at least been competent in her treatment.

“Healthy diet &amp; 30-60 min exercise every day!!!” Just like that. A fake prescription with three exclamation points. It was the medical equivalent of that “hang in there” kitten poster.

Rage propelled Heleth out of the doctor’s office, but it was another three months before she recovered enough to attempt another doctor, and only through her ex’s monumental effort. Thanks to endless doomscrolling, she was also well aware that this treatment was typical, and definitely far from the worst that others had received. Nonetheless, it decayed her trust in the medical establishment enough that she still balked every time she needed to get her prescription refilled.

Heleth blinked herself back into focus before the panic band could tighten around her chest. *Bet Skeletor here never had a fatphobic doc*, her asshole brain commented.

*That’s not fair*, she thought back at… herself. Then she reminded herself that such conversations are not indicative of, nor conducive to, mental health, and she concentrated fully on Quyen’s continuing tale.

The skeleton had a litany of grotesqueries that aspiring doctors—and even already-doctors—performed on dying and dead patients. Heleth began to feel melodramatic about her own experiences; after all, no one had used her femur to simulate sexual acts.

She caught another of Lovelace’s “humans are mega-fucked up” glances and shook her head, indicating the cat shouldn’t interrupt.

Quyen held up a hand. It seemed a little off to Heleth. “I lost the tip of a pinkie when one of the ‘finest minds of a generation’ dared another to swallow it. I’m missing my left fibula because the third son of a duke thought it would make a novel writing implement. I have been a puppet, a mascot, a costume, a decoration, and a prop. I have had things tied to me, painted on me, poured on me, poured out of me, draped on me, and scrawled on me. Once I died, I became nothing. Worse than nothing.”

Quyen had no facial expression, and her stillness betrayed no body language. Yet Heleth felt sure that, had the skeleton possessed musculature and fatty tissue and skin and tear ducts, that tears would be rolling down her cheeks. Her impression was confirmed by Lovelace, who padded over to the skeleton and gave her a comfort display that involved hyper-purrs and belly exposure.

“All the stories I’ve heard here,” Heleth said quietly, “there’s been something kinda the same in all of them. They all connected really deeply to something human. I was starting to think there might be something to it, that maybe it could help to explain how this happened to all of you. Like a spark that gave you sentience.”

The skull tipped, just a fraction of an angle. “I was already human. I don’t need a ‘spark’.”

“I didn’t mean—”

Nice Sunday. Breakfast, read for a bit. Mostly got the netting up for the chickens to be able to go out. Will try to finish tomorrow. Did a little painting before dinner. Seem to have developed a nasty headache this evening, though. Did managed to talk to both Dad and Mom. Mom&#39;s deliberate ignorance on all things despite her having vehement opinions is driving me nuts. She falls prey to every sensationalist thing ever. Gah.

“Don’t think for a second that I’m like every other object in here.” The skeleton leaned forward a fraction. “I am human. I was human. I lived a life. I had a family. I loved people, and I worked, and I ate, and I was healthy and sick and angry and heartbroken and joyful and tired and lonely and loved and comforted. I died, and upon that death I *became* an object. I have lived the life that no human ever should, but which I know so many have anyway, as they are bartered and sold and abused and mistreated and killed and left by governments to be collateral damage or acceptable casualties. I have seen how the medical profession has always treated patients, has always been trained to treat patients: not as people, because emotion is an enemy. They cannot afford to actually care about people, you know. So people become objects, not only in death but in life.

“Remember, I knew a time when caring for others was not a profession. It was not something you earned a degree in. It was a thing that you did because you cared about those around you. Because they were your family, your tribe, your own network of people who cared about you, and would take care of you. Not that long ago, women were crucified for caring about people as they always have, branded as witches and cast out, vilified, drowned and burned because they did not do things the same way that men did. I have seen these pretenders to the thrones of caregivers scoff at ‘savagery’ and ‘shamanism’, in favor of their own religion of medical science, only to return to those so-called barbaric methods as they discovered that those methods had worked for thousands of years for a *reason*. But we cannot place faith in tradition and emotion and compassion, only in data and evidence and cold calculation.

Productive day, even though I woke up feeling like ass. Headache, stuffy, sore throat. Paul brought me paracetamol extra, tho, and I got my ass up and did stuff, and before long I felt normal. Finished the chicken marquee so they can go outside in quarantine. Got the first coat of color paint on the rest of the downstairs halls, which was a job and a half because of all the edging (so many doorways!). But now the rest of it will be much easier. Even managed to get the tie-ins to the duvet cover and duvet, so Paul&#39;s wool duvet will stop sagging and sliding inside the cover. I hope it works!

“Even though I have no flesh, no meat, no face, I am still human. I am human, and all these things are just that. Things.”

Heleth faltered. Lovelace vigorously scratched an ear with her hind foot.

“But they are not just things,” Heleth said softly, countering the edge in Quyen’s voice. “They have histories and memories and stories. And feelings.”

“Are you insane?”

Lovelace perked up at this, and Heleth glared at her. “It’s always a possibility,” Heleth said. “Also a possibility is that I am in a coma. But assuming that this is any kind of reality, and I am here as much as you are, I don’t think I’m any more batty than the next per—I mean, the next being.” Something began to dawn on Heleth. “Can you tell me, what exactly is it you do here?”

“I keep inventory.” Quyen tapped the label maker, then gestured to a shelf of green-backed ledgers. Heleth had missed them in the shadows, in her exhaustion and elation and confusion.

“Inventory,” Heleth repeated. “So you make a note of every object when it arrives, every object when it leaves—”

“No object ever leaves here.”

“So I’m told.”

Lovelace padded to the corner of the desk nearest Heleth and sat down, waiting.

Heleth rolled onward. “Where do the new objects come in?”

“Wherever it is they are to be shelved.”

“You mean they just appear in a spot on the shelves? You don’t have to, I dunno, sign for them?”

“No.”

“Damn, that’s a good service! I can’t even get my delivery folks to knock loudly, much less put my stuff away for me.”

The skeleton cocked her head, unsure.

“How do you know when an object arrives?” Heleth asked. “This is a really big place.”

Quyen’s skull tucks toward her sternum. “I don’t know how I know. I am here at all times. I wait. And then, I am not here. I am there, wherever in the warehouse the object has appeared. I label it, I log it, and as soon as the entry is finished, I am once more here.”

Whew. Tiring day - another marathon elit evaluation day. I still have a crap-ton to do for the New Media Prize, too. Bah. 

R: The Wanderers (gonna be a long one - 30 hour audiobook), Gods Monsters and the Lucky Peach (finished), Bloodline. W: 0. L: 0. Tons of elit perused.

“Wait,” Heleth said, and even Lovelace turned to cock an ear at the skeleton. “You just teleport from here to there and back again whenever a new object arrives?”

“Teleport?” Quyen asked.

“Get magically whisked from one place to another, without ever being in between.”

“Teleport.” The skeleton tasted the word. “Yes, that is what happens.”

“So you have no idea,” Heleth expanded, “how objects get here, or why?”

“I have no idea how I got here or why, much less the objects.”

“Huh.” Heleth slumped back against the wall, pondering. “The objects never see you. They would’ve told me. They would have passed it down the grapevine.”

“Grapevine?” Quyen’s speech was modern enough, but she seemed to be missing the nuance in colloquialisms. “And what do you mean, ‘see me’ and they ‘told’ you? They are objects. Have you met someone else here?” The skeleton’s ribcage leaned forward a mite in eagerness.

“No, just you and me and the cat. Oh holy bejeebus.” Heleth stood up, and to her surprise she did it all in one fluid movement, buoyed by her excitement. “Do you mean to tell me you don’t know these objects are sentient?”

Now the bones leaned back and laughed. The skull tipped back, the jaw fell open, and a hearty guffaw heaved forth. “Sentient? You *are* mad. Are you truly under the impression that the items in this warehouse are intelligent beings?”

Heleth looked to Lovelace, just to get confirmation. Lovelace twitched a whisker, in what Heleth interpreted as a shrug-like “I’m with you.”

“That’s the whole thing about this warehouse,” Heleth confirmed. “Every item in it is self-aware. Including, apparently, you.”

“Ridiculous.”

“As ridiculous as a walking, talking skeleton that teleports around taking inventory? By the way, you speak very well for a rice farmer from the Dark Ages.”

“I inhabited the highest institutions of knowledge for far longer than I ever mucked around in rice paddies,” Quyen said, her voice cold. “While you, clearly, spent most of your time off with the fairies.”

Relaxing day. Horrible weather, cleaner didn&#39;t come, nothing happening, so mostly just read. Painted a little. Watched Hamilton for the first time - WOW. Lin Manuel Miranda is a freaking genius. Amazeballs.

R: Wanderers, Bloodline (finished), Subcutanean. W: Hamilton. L: Taylor for-evermore.

Heleth rolled her eyes, finally letting her feelings about the skeleton’s ongoing condescension out into her face. “Are you seriously telling me you’ve never touched an object and had it speak to you?”

“I’ve never touched an object in this warehouse.” The skeleton remained seated, hands now facedown on the desktop. “Why would I? What would I do with it?”

“Lovelace, correct me if I’m wrong, but the objects can talk to each other even if they’re not touching.”

“Indeed,” Lovelace replied.

At this, Quyen rose with a start, her eye sockets trained toward the cat. Heleth blinked until she realized that this was the first time Lovelace had spoken since the skeleton appeared.

“You are playing tricks on me,” the ancient medical specimen accused Heleth.

“I’m really not. Look, sit back down. Now it’s time I told you a story or two.” Heleth gestured to the chair, even as she eased herself slowly back down to sitting on the cot. Lovelace and Quyen eyed each other, Quyen with the blank stare of a bleached skull and Lovelace with the blank stare of an average, everyday housecat. Finally, the skeleton eased herself back down.

“I notice you never asked how Lovelace and I came to be here,” Heleth began.

“Technically, she did,” Lovelace reminded her. “When she first arrived back here. You, typically, bowled right past that.”

“Sure,” Heleth agreed. “Makes sense. Anyway.” She turned back to the skeleton. “To answer your question, I’m Heleth, and this is Lovelace. We’re just traveling through, and in doing so have discovered what is special about this warehouse: every object stored here has become sentient. Everything in here is, more or less, alive.”

Heleth proceeded to fill Quyen in on the nature of the items she’d been logging for probably hundreds of years. She rushed through a couple of the objects’ stories, parlaying the flavor and theme, if not the entire contents.

Really quiet day. Weather much better. Jake back to normal. Chicken marquee survived yesterday&#39;s storm completely, which I&#39;m rather pleased about. Read my books, chilled, mostly. But didn&#39;t fall asleep for nap! Yay me.

R: Subcutanean (finished), China Mountain Zhang, Wanderers. W: Ghosts Xmas special, Hogfather. L: Taylor for-evermore.
[continue]
“So, see,” Heleth finished somewhat lamely, “there is something special about every item in here, including you.”

Quyen said nothing. She neither moved nor laughed nor breathed.

After several long moments of absolutely no response, Heleth and Lovelace eyed one another quizzically. Heleth shrugged.

“I’m surprised,” Heleth said, “that you haven’t come across any of this in your time here. I mean, as a fellow ob—resident in the warehouse, I would have thought you could hear them speak to you.”

“Not to mention the enigma of how you label and index every new item while remaining undetectable somehow to all the objects around it.”

More silence.

“Did we zap her?” Heleth whispered to the cat.

“You can be rather overwhelming,” the tortie replied.

“Me? Like anyone takes a talking cat perfectly in stride.”

“I don’t believe you.” When Quyen finally interrupted their squabbles, it was strident, sure.

Heleth sighed. “Maybe she falls more on the human side than the object side,” she pontificated to Lovelace. “If she’s really never touched an object—”

“Of course I’ve never touched an object.”

“—then she won’t know they can speak to us,” Lovelace finished. “It still doesn’t explain their lack of awareness of her.”

“No,” Heleth agreed. “It doesn’t. Does she only catalogue when they’re asleep or something?”

“They don’t sleep, you numpty,” Lovelace reminded her.

“Oh yeah. Well, maybe it’s at a certain time. Or there’s a window for logging that is in a pocket dimension. Or all time and awareness stops while she’s in the warehouse, not in this room. Or she’s somehow invisible to objects, but not to living beings like us. Or…”

“Or her fairy godmother picks her up and puts her down wherever,” Lovelace continued, her voice a tonal eye roll. “We could make up stories all day, but it would be quicker just to test these things.”

Heleth clapped. “Fun!”

Only when she turned back to Quyen, it was clear the skeleton regarded none of this as “fun.”

Had a nice christmas with french toast and chicken fried steak. We watched Die Hard, Muppet Xmas Carol, Happiest Season, and Scrooged. Read my new graphic novels, enjoyed my new borg robe from Amy. Good day was had by all.

R: Wanderers, The Massacre of Mankind, Pretty Deadly, Bitch Planet. W: as above. L: Xmas music.

Heleth and Lovelace determinedly ignored the attitude.

“Okay, what are our test states?” Heleth asked Lovelace, opening her notebook yet again.

“We need to test what happens if she touches an object.”

“Alone *and* with one of us.”

“Of course.” Lovelace began to clean between her toes. It was her hypothesizing ritual. “She will also need to be nearby while we talk to an object, to see if the object is aware of her.”

“That one should be first,” Heleth said, scribbling.

“Indeed.”

“Ooh, we should also try all of these scenarios without us at all. Maybe observing from a distance?”

Lovelace agreed, but added, “Perhaps from within this office. A cracked door ought to be sufficient.”

“Right-o,” Heleth said. “So, Quyen near the objects, not touching. Quyen touching objects, alone. Quyen near the objects when we touch them, and finally, all three of us touching an object.”

“Should we try several different objects, possibly a set number in several different locations around the warehouse?”

“Oh, yes, more robustly testing the variables—”

“Enough!” Quyen shouted, standing. “I am not a laboratory rodent.”

Lovelace paused, her teeth around one claw. Heleth blinked.

“Okay, okay, we maybe got carried away,” Heleth said.

“Yes,” Lovelace sighed. “It’s not like we’re going to be able to publish this experiment anyway. No one else could possibly verify our results.”

“Publish?” Heleth turned back to the cat. “Please tell me there aren’t cat scientists, and cat scientific journals. There’s only so much I can take.”

“Not specifically feline, no, but cats publish. Did you think all authors were strictly human? Have you never heard of F.D.C. Willard, at the very least? I thought you went to school.”

Heleth shook her head. “I only know Fred Willard. Was he the guy in *Pitch Perfect*?”

Lovelace put her paw down and stared at her so-called owner. “And humans are supposed to be the apex species on this planet. You just have better spin doctors.”

Quiet day. Breakfast, walk with Paul &amp; Newt. Jake&#39;s back to normal, thank fuck. Newt caught and killed a rabbit, and eventually we prized it off him, much to his dismay. Poor guy. All 5 chickens out today, for the first time as far as I&#39;ve seen. They all ran out the door soon as I opened it, and it was a comedy of errors trying to get them back in. Goobers. Then listening to audiobook and snoozing while snuggling with Moose, a little painting, watching ballet with Amy. Nice day.

“Right now,” Heleth told Quyen, “this little teaspoon is singing me a nursery rhyme. It was the song its owner’s little boy would sing as he used his mother’s good silver—the spoon—to dig outside in the mud. Much to her dismay, of course. I can hear it. Can you?”

The skeleton remained standing, still with her arms folded across her ribcage. Heleth wondered if, indeed, she’d gotten her wrist joints hooked over a rib or something, and was actually stuck.

“Lovey, can you hear the spoon?”

“No, of course not,” the cat replied. “I am not touching it.”

Heleth laid her opposite hand on the cat’s back. “Now?”

“Still no. But interesting experiment. Your contact with the spoon does not transfer to me.”

Heleth held the spoon out for Lovelace to lean into. “And now?”

“‘Molly put the kettle on, Molly put the kettle on,’” Lovelace sang. “Oldie but a goodie.”

“Quyen, you hear that?” After a few moments, Heleth said, “Come on, it’s not hard to play along. Don’t you want to know? Don’t you want to figure out what this place is and why you’re here?”

“Stop! Just stop it.” The skeleton dropped her arms, palms down on the desk, her skull hanging.

Quietly, Heleth placed the spoon on the desktop, murmuring to it that she would replace it soon. She waited.

“I don’t even know how many years, decades, centuries I’ve been here,” Quyen said, grinding the words out. “Let’s say a hundred. Whatever unit you want to use. A hundred years, a hundred centuries, I have no idea.”

Heleth could have narrowed it down—it was only a couple of centuries ago that medical science progressed to what Quyen had described, so she could only have been here a few hundred years at most. She stayed quiet, however.

“I have had no control,” the skeleton said, the words spitting as though she had lips. “No autonomy. I spent decades—*decades*—gathering dust in lecture halls and science labs. I know that I am not possible. I know that teleportation is not possible. Your cat is not possible. And yet here we all are.

“Look at this room. It has only ledgers of the items within for entertainment and edification. No books. No social calls. No music or dancing or plays. I have been confined here for far longer than you have been alive. At random intervals I am whisked away—teleported, as you say—to log yet another of millions, and back again as soon as my pencil picks up from the page. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. But I still think. I still live.

“You think I have never wondered at all this? That I have never tried to puzzle out the mysteries of this place? The magic of it? Hundreds of years here for me. Dozens, millennia, it does not matter. Nothing to do, no one to talk to. Do you think I did not try to figure it out? That I never turned my mind to the rats’ nest of impossibility in which I live?”

Heleth staggered. Her mouth fished as she sucked in breath to talk and then all her words wedged in her throat.

Lovelace settled herself into a loaf position. “Bones here has a point, Heleth. You could be a little more sensitive.”

“I swear to god, Lovelace,” Heleth said between clenched teeth. The tortie squeezed her eyes shut. To Quyen, Heleth said, “I’m sorry. I can’t even imagine what it’s been like for you.”

The skeleton sniffed. It wasn’t really an intake of breath through the nose, since she had neither nostrils nor lungs, just a twitch of the skull and a feeling. “I like your cat,” Quyen said.

Heleth barked out a surprised laugh. “She grows on you. Like black mold.”

I keep getting dates wrong on these. Oh well.

Nothing very exciting today. Breakfast, cleaned chickens, carrots to ponies, read for a while, napped, dinner, TV. The end.

[continue]
They all stared at each other a long while. Heleth thought about how much they all had in common. Strange missions that defied logic and sense. Not even knowing what their missions were. Wandering endlessly through a maze of unexplained phenomena, never knowing when or even if things were ever going to change.

Then, of course, they had a lot less in common. Heleth and Lovelace had flesh, for one. They were both less than a century old. And, of course, only one of them was a cat.

“Look,” she told Quyen. “I understand. It’s a lot, and we totally blindsided you here.”

“Your appearance was certainly unexpected.”

“I bet. And then I go shoving inanimate objects at you.” They all looked at the spoon, lying innocently there on the desk. “I’m sorry. I’ve been trying so hard for so long to figure out why I’m here, what’s going on here, how to get out, that I didn’t stop to put myself in your sh—er, position.”

The skeleton was still for a moment, then nodded slowly. “Apology accepted. And I can say I understand your enthusiasm. Had a similar thing happened to me in the first months, even years, of my time here, I might have reacted the same way.”

When they both turned to Lovelace, the cat flitted her ears. “What? I’m a delight.”

“Like I said,” Quyen told Heleth, “I like your cat.”

“You want a pet?” Heleth asked, but of course she didn’t mean it. “Well. What now?”

The skull dropped a fraction, its sockets pointed toward the desk. “I suppose we might as well give this a try.”

Bony fingers reached across the desk. Tentatively, Quyen touched a phalange-tip to the dull silver of the spoon.

Heleth and Lovelace watched, holding their breath. They could hear nothing but the faint rasp of bone on cutlery.

It was only a few seconds before the skeleton pulled her arm back, leaving the spoon where it lay.

“Did you hear its story?” Heleth asked.

The skull tipped sideways. “I wouldn’t call it hearing. It’s more that I now *know* its story.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Neither do I.”

When Quyen offered nothing more, Heleth reached out to take the spoon back. She cradled it in her palm and waited for its high clear voice to resonate in her head.

Only it remained silent.

“Hullo?” Heleth said softly. “Uh, spoon?”

Nothing.

Lovelace nosed at it, but she couldn’t rouse it either.

“It’s—is it dead?” Heleth asked.

Hearing the word, Lovelace gave it the cat test, batting it with a paw. It clattered to the floor. Even on picking it up, Heleth got no reaction from it.

“A mere thing cannot die,” Quyen said.

“But it was alive. It was. It talked to me.”

“And it gave its story to me.”

Heleth gently laid the spoon on the desk, reverently, as though she were laying it to rest. She felt a lump grow in her throat. She was about to cry over cutlery.

Something stung her thigh. She blinked the tears out of her eyes and looked down to find Lovelace’s claw stuck in her pajama pants.

“Do the bones seem less bony to you?” Lovelace asked, her voice low, hidden under a purr.

Heleth peered at Quyen. At first glance, she saw no difference at all. Same vertebrae, same ribs, same skull, same phalanges. Only she thought maybe the skeleton’s color might have changed. It was no longer the bright white of boiled and bleached bones, but more of an ivory. It was a tonal change, one shade on a paint chip, but the ivory hue definitely brought more life to the features. Weirdly.

Still getting dates wrong. Great.

So I realized today after watching The Vow that I grew up in a cult: Amway. My parents were SERIOUSLY invested in that my entire childhood, and after they divorced my dad kept hitting it hard till I was 25-30 or so. They still both have products they use regularly. Fucking wild. I got lost down that rabbit hole a while today.

Otherwise, another day.

“You’re giving her altogether too much credit,” Lovelace commented as she strode across the hood of the Model T. Apparently, she was like all other cats everywhere: incapable of ignoring an opportunity to track tiny pawprints across pristine black paint.

“Rude,” Heleth said.

“If you two are finished,” the automobile said, “might I perhaps be next?”

“Next…? Oh! Yes of course.” Heleth waved the skeleton over, and Quyen did her thing.

Once the Model T was released, and Quyen’s bones had yet another inestimable layer of tone to them, the skeleton turned to Heleth.

“All this time that I have been labelling and indexing. Was this what I was actually supposed to be doing?”

Heleth shrugged. “Hell if I know. It’s not like this place came with a manual.” She considered. “Did it?”

At Quyen’s glare—for now Heleth could tell well enough what was a glare and what was just comfortable eye-hole contact—she raised a hand. “Fine, fine, no manual.”

Lovelace dropped off the just-an-inanimate-vehicle-once-again and began winding herself through Heleth’s legs.

“Okay, well, uh, Quyen, it was really nice to meet you. I don’t want to tell you your job or anything, but it seems like you have a lot left to do, and I don’t want to delay you anymore, so…” Heleth began backing away, trying not to let the preening tortie cause a major accident. It would be just like her to kill Heleth now.

“Wait.” The skeleton held out her hand. “I should thank you. You are correct; I have a great deal of work to do, but I believe that, at the end of it, things will be very different for me. I want to thank you for turning me onto my path, however clumsily you have done it.”

“Uh, you’re welcome I guess,” Heleth replied, both glad to be thanked and mildly offended at how it was done. “If it’s okay with you, after the year the world has had, I think the friendly handshake needs to die a quick and not-so-sudden death.”

Took furniture to a friend today with the horse trailer, and Paul is a terrible navigator. As we turned down onto a PACKED and narrow one-lane track, I said &quot;Are you sure, because I&#39;ve got a horse trailer here and it&#39;s hard to turn around?&quot;, and he still directed me down it. He was wrong, and I had to reverse that thing down about a quarter mile of track. He was glad to be alive.

Also stopped at Stermat to air tires up, and I thought I&#39;d pick up some odds and ends in the hardware store. Mistake. NO ONE can follow covid restrictions. I hate people.

Otherwise, normal day. Downstairs hallway paint is FINALLY done, and now he wants me to do upstairs next. So that&#39;s my future!

The skeleton shrugged, and dropped her hand.

“Anyway, good luck. Maybe I’ll see you around.” Heleth chuckled. “You know, if Lovey and I can find a way out of here.”

At that, Lovelace butted into her legs even harder.

“Jeez, Lovelace, okay, I’m coming.” She offered Quyen an awkward wave, and followed the cat.

Through a portal, as it turned out. One moment the cat was there, and then she was disappearing between a china hutch and a tool shed. Surprised at the utter lack of fanfare and ceremony, Heleth stepped through as well.

“You could have just said ‘hey, Heleth, I found a door,’” she grumbled to the cat upon arriving once more at the chaotic maze of the internet’s back garden.

“I’m bored of telling you everything,” Lovelace complained.

“Holy *shit* do I have to pee. Toilet site, Lovey, stat!”

They took care of basic biology, in and out, and regrouped in the maze, as Heleth was coming to think of it. Heleth sat in a clearing of screen portals, their ambient light illuminating the wealth of chicken strips they’d snagged from a quick trip into a TGI Friday’s website.

“I feel off-kilter,” she told Lovelace as the cat smacked happily into her own serving of battered meat. “Like when you’ve been driving on the highway for a while and you stop, and your eyes haven’t adjusted to the world being still yet, and it feels like everything is moving away from you.”

“Yes, that happens to me all the time when I drive motor vehicles,” Lovelace deadpanned.

“Hush.” They chewed in silence for a bit, until Heleth couldn’t be still any longer. “Well,” she said. “What now?”

From her predatory crouch, Lovelace tilted her head up. “Seems like you’re the director of this cruise to crazyville. I just drive the ship. It will be up to you.”

“Gee, thanks.”

Back to work tomorrow. Paul and I had a lazy day. Slept late, and he put on Taylor Swift&#39;s Folklore documentary for me, which was lovely. Just watched stuff and ate dinner and chilled.

Heleth sucked down some Coke Zero. Everything tasted like that first draught of water after a month in the desert. She lay on her back in the black, dangling chicken strips over her own face. Her peripheral vision filled with thousands of blue rectangles, a mosaic of potentialities. She could only fathom the in-betweens, however. The empty spaces where she and Lovelace existed, they reflected her. With the world still spinning in that strange aftermath, she felt inside out, like she was looking into her own guts. She felt lightheaded.

“Lovelace, are you tired?”

“I could sleep. I like to nap after a big meal. And before a big meal.”

“I’m so tired.”

“So sleep.”

Heleth closed her eyes. She lay an arm across them, blocking out the light, and swam there in the swirling pinks and purples and greens. “No,” she said, but it was muffled by her forearm. She dropped it and sat up. “No. It took for*ever* to figure it out, Lovey, but we were in that warehouse for a reason. We had a purpose. We made a difference. That’s what we’re doing! Let’s go do it again.”

Lovelace batted at the last of her chicken, sated but still willing to play predator games. “I don’t need a purpose.”

“Your purpose is to give me a stomach ache.” Heleth rolled to her knees, then stepped her way to standing. “And to find doors out when I’m done. Come on, you bum.”

“Fine. I call hoodie.”

Heleth complied, packing the sleepy kitty into her hood and tying it secure. She wandered for a while, passing on sites about math problems and beach erosion and the best summer holidays. When she finally chose a site, it was because she didn’t know what it was about, rather than because she did.

The screen had a white background, with eight block capital words in black: THE FUTURE IS YOU. WILL YOU FIND IT?

She had no idea whether she would find it or not, but she reached out and touched the screen, suddenly interested in fathoming its unfathomable question.

First day back at work - spent it catching up on all the e-lit reading and voting for New Media Writing Prize and ELC vol. 4. Always makes me really tired. On the plus side, the emails after the break were manageable, so pretty awesome.

Heleth stepped through the screen portal, from the digital dark behind the internet to the bright noon sun of an endless blue-white sky. Through her murderous bunny slippers, she felt the rough, sticky texture of hot asphalt, and as the sun beamed like a massive laser through her hoodie she regretted letting the cat use it as a hammock. It was like using a hot water bottle as a scarf.

Her pupils constricted, and she blinked back the instant tears that had formed from the blinding sunlight. She was in the middle of a two-lane stretch of highway across a flat prairie, nothing but a ribbon of charcoal quilting the rolling bolts of blonde scrub grass. There was no sign of the site—

Nope, wait. There was indeed a sign. Literal signs, in fact. As she turned to take in 360 degrees of her surroundings, she found a series of billboards behind her, trailing off into the horizon hand-in-hand with the blacktop. The first, just as she’d seen it through the screen portal, black on white: THE FUTURE IS YOU. WILL YOU FIND IT?

Heleth began walking, stepping gingerly as the road gravel stung her feet through her thin slippers. She’d assumed she’d be walking for ages, but that assumption was based on her experience of real-world physics and highways, where billboards were spaced to be read at 60 m.p.h. As she moved forward, she wondered if her slippers had magically transformed into seven-league bunny boots: though her body told her it was strolling along at a normal human pace, the speed of travel through the environment made her feel like The Flash. She still hadn’t let go of her vertigo from the warehouse, and this dissonance rung her bell once again.

She kept her focus on the billboards, each in sequence as a relatively stationary touchstone.

ARE YOU HAPPY? asked the second billboard. Heleth thought this a rather rude question to pose when they’d only just met. It wasn’t one she was comfortable with. Was she happy. Was anyone happy? What was happy? There was momentary happy, sure, but all the time happy? Unicorns and mermaids were all the time happy, maybe.

She didn’t have much chance to contemplate the question, however, before her seven-league slippers carried her down the road to the next larger than life question.

MONEY = TIME

The signs were getting less profound as she walked. Everyone knew money was time and time was money. Of course, not everyone’s time was created equal. Her time was probably only worth the cost of a TV dinner per unit.

ARE YOU WHO YOU EXPECTED TO BE?

That was more like it. A question whose answer changed according to different parameters. Who had she expected to be when she was seven years old? Ten? Eighteen? In what manner? Some people always took this as a job question, comparing their young dreams of fulfilling careers to current realities. Others took it as a family question, or a religious question. She’d wanted to be an artist as a kid, painting and drawing and sculpting all the time. She’d envisioned life in a big city, with a romantic yet functional studio and people with worldly accents fawning over her. As she grew, this desire morphed into the more practical aim of graphic design, which had opened the door to IT (or closed the door to fine art—Heleth definitely felt the two were in different buildings).

She’d also expected to still be married, maybe have kids. Maybe be in a light comedy of a mid-life crisis by now. No kid, she reflected, looks forward to spending a months-long pandemic in stretchy pants with only a cat for company.

Samey sort of day. Nothing much exciting.

Oh damn. Except for the MAGAts storming the Capitol Building in DC, someone getting shot, and storming capitols in other states. Trying to prevent Congress from accepting (ratifying?) the electoral votes. Domestic terrorism &amp; sedition for sure. Also, Georgia&#39;s run-off congressional elections turned Congress blue, and that fueled them, too. Biden has a massive mandate now. Also, Trump still refuses to concede. Who knew the revolution would come from the people who least need a revolution.

ARE YOU LIVING THE DREAM?

The text was in all caps, but Heleth still detected mega-caps for The Dream. What was it, she wondered? Movie mentors always told young people to follow their dream, but that was because they were movie characters and movie characters always *got* their dream, or learned that it was the wrong dream and so they got something better, or learned something profound. Movie ballet dancers or singers or writers or astronauts were always The Best, only held back by their own inner issues, and once they resolved them (neatly, of course, always neatly), they succeeded in being The Best. Movies never accounted for the millions of other people who *wanted* to be The Best and didn’t have inner demons and were actually Just Okay at whatever their Dream was. In the real world, Heleth knew, almost entirely everyone settled.

She heard Lovelace snorepurr on the nape of her neck, and realized that cats were entirely the opposite of humans when it came to their Dreams, capital D. Almost entirely every cat was living their Dream, inner demons included. The inner demons, after all, were part of cats, part and parcel, the whole cat package.

WANT TO?

Well, that was rather enticing, wasn’t it? Of course she wanted to live The Dream. Just as soon as she figured out what it was.

The last billboard had no text, only an image: an enormous arrow, pointing diagonally down. As Heleth reached the base of the sign, she discovered what it was pointing to: a rural road leading off the highway and into the flatlands. She peered into the distance, squinting, trying to see where it led. No luck. Good thing she had her seven-league bunny slippers on.

She followed the arrow down the rusty dirt road, ignoring the niggle in the corner of her mind that said the kind of dreams that waited at the end of such neglect and desolation were quite possibly not the kind with capital Ds.

Good day today. The seditionists did not win, but neither were they arrested, of course, because ACAB. But at least Congress ratified Biden&#39;s presidency.

She was always going to follow the signs, obviously. She’d chosen that screen portal specifically to follow the signs to see where they led. Even so, as Heleth walked and Lovelace snored, she worried about how quickly she was moving into ever more remote regions of what appeared to be a vastly unpopulated swathe of middle America (Australia? Canada? Russia? China? She really couldn’t be sure). What if this were a bad place? Worse than being stuck forever in a library of talking objects?

No help for it now, she knew as she remembered that the warehouse had only let them out once they’d actually accomplished something. Or that Lovelace had only revealed a way out once they’d accomplished that something; same difference, really, since Heleth could no more detect their exit doors than she could jump over the moon.

The track was straight and flat, though narrower and with less definition than the highway, so it wasn’t as easy to see where it was going. And since she had no signs to read along the way, she quickly got bored of striding at inhuman speeds toward a never-changing horizon. She sang camp songs for a while, then some sea shanties (mostly made up because she’d only ever heard sea shanties on the *Pirates of the Caribbean* movies). Eventually she resorted to “99 bottles of beer on the wall”, and every TV theme song she could remember, attempting to put them in alphabetical order according to show title. It was, in short, a long walk.

Eventually, however, boxy shapes miraged out of the horizon. She didn’t spot them at first, as a version of road hypnosis had taken over and all her eyes saw after a while was a blur of sun spotted grasses. She was almost on them before a more alert part of her brain smacked her out of it and called them to her attention.

Busy day today. Met up with folks about work, all my friends were very chatty on messenger apps, and then Levi wanted to talk because he was a bit worried about the viva as the examiners have asked that I not be there. That wound up being 2 hours. Gah, I hope that viva goes okay. Imma smash some heads if it doesn&#39;t.

Then Jennifer messaged to say some homeschoolers wanted to do YCO2 over the weekend, and so I needed to get the site into shape, which meant the capability to have them create their own codenames and enter them into the system. That took me till nearly 9pm, but then got my normal evening with Amy &amp; Paul &amp; Sam, so all good.

She thought at first it was a small town, but as her eyes focused she struggled to make sense of the shapes. It was as though a giant had crafted clay bricks and arranged them like children’s blocks. They were stacked in rectangular quadrants, in some places stepping up to three stories high. It felt Mongolian, or Mesoamerican, like black and white photos from school textbooks on ancient civilizations come to life.

Her seven-league bunny slippers quickly brought her to the structures, and she realized that in the waning afternoon light figures like ants were moving through them. People. The blocks were teeming with people. Well, that was something at least. She wouldn’t expire all alone out here. She hoped fervently that this place wasn’t just a reversal of the last: a bunch of objects that looked like people but actually had no sentience whatsoever. She didn’t know how she would solve that one. Go find some ghosts to put into the bodies?

Before she could consider it at any length, she was there. A squat rectangle of a building toed out from the rest, a roomy porch on the front shaded by a woven grass roof. A wooden sign posted out front said simply, “Welcome.”

“Well, Lovelace,” Heleth said softly to her still slumbering feline, “at least they seem friendly.” She took a deep breath, and stepped onto the front porch.

As soon as she did, she felt everything slow around her; her seven-league bunny slippers turning once more into her ordinary old bunnies. The effect was like stepping off a very fast moving walkway at the airport, and she stumbled a bit, her head swaying.

The front door was propped open, with a screen door to shut out bugs and let in a breeze. Heleth pulled it open, wincing at the shriek from its spring.

“Well hello.” The voice came from inside, a pleasant, feminine tone that was either sisterly or Stepfordly.

The change from blinding sunlight to siesta-dim interior left Heleth blind for several long moments as she let the screen door close softly behind her. “Hullo,” she said in the general direction of the woman.

“I’m so sorry,” the woman said. “I was taking a bit of a moment for myself, and utterly forgot about the lighting.” As she spoke, the light in the room increased—no further bulbs lit, no lamps clicking on, no overhead switching, just an overall dimmer increasing from “naptime darkness” to “reading nook cozy”.

Heleth expected a welcome center vibe, a little reception desk with a spry gray haired lady in a broomstick skirt with lots of oversized jewelry. She should really stop expecting things. While outside the structures seemed rough and primitive, inside, now that her eyes had adjusted, was comfortable and farm-like, but in no way lacking in mod-cons. There was no reception desk at all. Just a multi-fuel stove, unlit in this heat, matching sofas and armchairs that looked comfortable enough to live in, but also like they each cost more than Heleth made in three months. Artwork hung on the whitewashed walls; she had no notion of who might have created them or what they were worth, but they bore no resemblance to the typical hodge-podge of prints typically found in other people’s houses, and certainly none to the cheap and bland works breaking the monotony of your average beige hotel walls.

Her greeter, if that’s what the woman was, had neither gray hair nor hippie style. She was about Heleth’s age, but that was the only similarity Heleth could see. This woman would not be caught dead in ratty old PJs and comedy bunny slippers. She would never forget to brush her hair for two or three days, or put a bit of makeup on to pop out to the shops. Not that she probably even needed to wear makeup.

Still bleeding through everything today, and more weepy. Fun! The dog rescue people are being dog rescue people and having drama with each other, so today was spent trying to find dog transporters. It looks like I&#39;ll be meeting a transporter in Chester/Lymm area on Tuesday to pick the pup up. Sigh. Rescues, amiright?

Otherwise, quiet day. Talked to Mom. Forgot to call Dad! Now I&#39;m in bed and it&#39;s too late. Should message this week.

She only wore jeans and boots and blouse, but these were not farmers’ denim and scuffed old ropers. The jeans cupped her and hugged her and flared just right. The blouse looked tailor-made; paired with jeans it was lovely and feminine, but pair it with a pencil skirt and heels and it would turn heads in a boardroom or talk show.

Heleth wasn’t sure whether she should say hello again or ask for an autograph. This was not your ordinary woman. She was someone you cut out of a magazine and taped to your fridge, initially for life goals, then eventually so you could claim she had better genetics or richer parents or more useful networks, and that was why she was amazing and you were eating ice cream out of the carton alone at 3am. Not that, er, Heleth had ever done such a thing.

She finally found her voice, and croaked out, “Uh, that’s okay. Um.”

The Perfect Woman (for she already occupied fridge space in Heleth’s head) smiled her straight, sparkling smile and waved to a pair of armchairs set kitty-corner to one another. “Please, join me, and tell me what brings you to us.”

Heleth shuffled to a chair and sat with a plop, only to have a dozen needles drive into the back of her neck. Visions of Bond villain poison darts streaked through Heleth’s imagination before the combination screech and hiss reminded her, belatedly, that Lovelace was asleep in her hood. Had been asleep. Till Heleth squished her, moderately.

“Shit piss fucking *ow*,” she said, leaning  forward enough for Lovelace to free herself and leap to the back of the chair. “Sorry, Lovey, I forgot you were there.”

Lovelace smacked the back of her head and proceeded to wash herself indignantly.

“Are you all right?” the Perfect Woman asked, eyes wide.

“Yeah, fine. Happens all the time. She’s a grumpy git.”

OUR NEW PUPPY IS HERE!!! Newton is being grumpy and territorial, as I expected, but Charlie already adores him and follows wherever he goes. Charlie&#39;s not yet keen on us; I haven&#39;t even gotten to pet him. But he&#39;ll get there. He&#39;s good with the cats, having a sniff and basically ignoring, so that&#39;s all we really need.

Levi passed his viva this evening. He was disappointed in the result - technically majors, but really minors with extra time given because he has a baby to take care of. I&#39;ve got to beat some esteem into him.

Didn&#39;t sleep much last night, and I feel like I didn&#39;t do much today. Ah, well.

*Oh, here we go,* Heleth thought. *The pitch.* She took a long drink of the water, again grateful for its coolness, to give herself a moment to think. Then she decided she didn’t need it.

“Nope,” she said. “I mean, why else would I be here, right?”

Lovelace bit off a nail with that snap-pulling noise that always sounded like bones breaking.

Nora smiled. “You’d be so surprised at how many people come here and try to convince me how great their lives are. When they can only stay a weekend so they can get back to their J-O-Bs!” At Heleth’s expression, she explained, “Just Over Broke. That’s what we call jobs.”

“Ah.” Heleth palmed a couple more crackers. “So you don’t have jobs here?”

“We don’t need them. We have freed ourselves from the neo-liberal capitalist prison.”

“So you don’t need money?”

Nora kept smiling. “What would you rather have, Heleth—time or money?”

Heleth felt a glitch in the matrix, déjà vu, but then she remembered that these were basically the messages she’d read on the billboards. “Well, I guess money gives you more time, right?”

“You’d think that. But have you noticed that the more money you have, the less time you get to potentially enjoy it? Tell me, Heleth, do you have children?”

Lovelace jumped down into Heleth’s lap and sat there, tall and Egyptian, staring at Nora’s sculpted face.

“Heh, only if you include the furry kind,” Heleth said.

“I can see she means so much to you, Heleth.” Nora reached forward to scritch the little tortie on the head. Heleth tensed, because she could read the cat’s body language even if the Perfect Woman couldn’t: Lovelace was ready to slice some Nivea-commercial quality skin. “Don’t you regret the time you don’t spend with her?”

“I think if I spent any more time with her, she might cut my throat in my sleep.” Again, Heleth offered an awkward laugh.

“She thinks that because it’s true,” Lovelace confirmed.

Very tired and want to go to bed. Good, solid day. Charlie Bear doing well, though he was very tired from his very long day to get here, so I don&#39;t expect the calm behaviour to last much longer. Newton doing better toward the end of the day. Moose and Esme absolutely absent.

Building escape room for Crucible next week. Fun, but so hard to do these puzzles! Gah.

Nora’s smile was unending. Lovelace definitely didn’t like it, but Heleth found it comforting. She liked it when people smiled at her. It didn’t happen often enough for her taste.

“I think,” Nora said, reaching out and placing one perfectly cool, dry, soft hand on Heleth’s forearm, “that it would do you a world of good to stay with us for a few days.”

“Days?” Heleth asked.

“Don’t worry.” Nora laughed those wind chimes again. “It’s not the Hotel California. You can leave whenever you want.”

“Whew,” Heleth said, smiling back.

Nora stood and nodded toward the door at the back of the room, which would lead to the center of the…village? Compound? What did they call it here, anyway? “Come with me, and I’ll show you around. Then you can decide. Sound good?”

“Uh, sure.” Heleth eyed the charcuterie board, which was mostly uneaten, and swiped a few slices of ham. For Lovelace, of course.

She followed Nora through the door, back into the sunshine, into what she could only describe as an oasis. The reception building opened onto a large central square, a plaza, that clearly served as a communal space. Paths snaked their way across, softened with crushed gypsum gravel, sparkling in the sun. They carved up clear spaces: a manicured lawn where a trio of women sat, chatting and laughing. A vegetable garden. A tetherball court. A deck that, while empty, had yoga mats rolled up to the side just waiting to be used. In the middle of the plaza, a gazebo large enough for dancing shielded visitors from the sun.

“You’ve come at a very quiet time for us. Midafternoon is the hottest time of the day, so most people spend it inside in the cool, resting, meditating, or reading.”

They walked down the stark white pathways, Lovelace trotting behind Heleth. “How many people live here?” Heleth asked.

Headache most of the day today, so it felt really long. Nothing spectacular. Charlie getting on better - having big playing sessions with Newt, which is great to see. Finished the escape room game for crucible next week. Hope it&#39;s not too hard. Quite tired now, and want to go to bed. Still have to do spanish.

“Only ten of us live here permanently,” Nora said, smiling and nodding to the group on the grass. “Many members come and go as they need guidance.”

“Oh. So what exactly is this? Like, a spa?”

Nora laughed. “If it were, I would have asked you for your credit card and put you in a fluffy robe as soon as you walked in.”

Heleth looked down at her hoodie and PJ bottoms. “I could probably use one.”

“We’ll get you there.”

Heleth had no idea what that meant, but she noted that Nora didn’t say her attire was no problem, that it didn’t matter. It clearly *did* matter.

“This might seem like a rude question, so please don’t take offense,” Heleth started as they entered a building across the plaza. “But y’all don’t burn a wicker man or anything, do you?”

“We don’t even weave baskets,” Nora said with a wink.

This building was much larger than reception, rising to three stories in steps. It was cool inside, with that siesta-dim lighting again. Once Heleth’s eyes adjusted, she took in the large space: the ground floor was completely open plan, dotted by thick logs pillaring the weight of the upper floors. It included a kitchen area, groups of sofas and chairs, a communal workspace with several laptop stations, desktops, and a printer, a large television with Bluetooth headphones lined up on a rod, and yet another bare space with yoga mats just waiting to be sweated on.

It was all very clean, but plain compared to the reception area. A lot of the furniture looked handmade, and while the kitchen was neat and tidy, its wares resembled secondhand shop hodgepodge.

“This is one of the residences. Ground floor is communal area; you can see we’re not very full at the moment, otherwise this space can get very active. Come, I’ll show you where you can rest before dinner.”

Migraine hangover today, so did the bare minimum to get work done for the day, then napped while listening to my book. Felt better by dinnertime, and Paul got pizza and we watched Staged. Charlie doing really well - I managed to help him figure out the dog door with a few strategically-placed treats. He&#39;s been a star, really.

Nora showed her to a second floor room much like a small hotel room. It had a bed, a chair, a desk, and a bathroom. No TV, no wifi—Heleth was secretly glad for that, because she didn’t want to know what kind of hole having wifi *inside* the internet would rip in the space-time continuum.

She and Lovelace cleaned up. Well, Heleth cleaned up, and Lovelace deposited a wad of fur on the chair seat. Heleth took a shower, finding a set of toiletries in the bathroom. There was a clean set of clothes, underpants and all, on top of the desk, and as she put them on she realized how disgusting her pjs and bunny slippers were.

Inside the desk drawer, she found a laminated sheet detailing the daily schedule for the—commune, was it? Compound? Village? She decided not to bias herself, and settled on “community”. Meals, lots of yoga (of course), and what looked oddly like business mixed with self-help seminars. She soon saw why the common areas were mostly deserted; afternoon was the heaviest time for these, and she had to assume they were the bread and butter of this place.

On the back of the sheet was a map of the community, and she located the cafeteria, various meeting rooms, a small gym, and a hot spring. She wasn’t sure a hot spring was the best idea in the middle of a scorching desert, but it also sounded like it would feel heavenly.

Without TV, internet, or a book, she left Lovelace napping in the room and wandered around, getting a feel for things. She found a shelf in the common room with a bunch of pop fiction, none newer than ten years old, and she made a mental list of titles she could stand to read. She scoped the cafeteria, which looked like a fancier version of every school food hall she’d ever been in.

Seminars seemed mostly centered in the largest building, which Heleth decided to call the Schoolhouse. On the second floor a long hallway led down a row of seminar rooms in the exact same setup as her residence hall. All the doors were shut, so all she could hear was murmurings from within. She wasn’t brave enough to pop her head into any of the rooms.

She was beginning to find the orderly emptiness unnerving. She walked back to the plaza, hoping to find the same women there, but they’d moved on. Nora was nowhere to be found, not even in Reception. Heleth fetched a book from her hall and went back to the cafeteria, figuring that was the most likely spot to meet up with someone else.

It didn’t take long. She was only two chapters into what the cover called a “domestic thriller”—which to Heleth seemed like a fancy way to say that you *never* knew what kind of psychopath you might be marrying—when a whole slew of folks came in. One of the seminars was on break, and everyone had to perk up a bit with caffeine.

A woman with a mug of hot water and a slice of lemon sat at Heleth’s table, across from her and a chair down. “You new?” she asked.

“Just got here,” Heleth said, feeling oddly like she was reading a script from a prison TV show. “Don’t even really know what it’s all about.”

The woman laughed, squeezing the lemon into her mug and then dropping the rind to the bottom of it. “Oh, you’ve got a long way to go then. You’ll have orientation tomorrow. If I were you, I’d enjoy the day of downtime. It gets pretty intense from here on out.” She held a hand out, its nails perfectly manicured, perfectly red. “I’m Ana. This is my third time here.”

Heleth gave a little wave. “Heleth. Sorry, bit of a germ phobe.” She had no idea if this desert representation of a website also suffered from the pandemic, but better safe than sorry. There were still computer viruses after all. “So you really get a lot out of being here, huh?”

“I know, I know, it seems like a lot of New Age hoo-ey,” Ana said, rolling her eyes. “But I just feel so… peaceful when I’m here. And like everyone is my family. Out in the world, I’m a lawyer, and I can’t trust anyone an inch, you know? It’s just nice to let all that go and be among My People. Capital M, capital P.”

“Wow. That’s really something,” Heleth said. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt like that.”

“Well, that’s why you’re here, of course.”

“Of course,” Heleth repeated. “So what is this all about, anyway? Like, religion, or what?”

“Nothing like that. Oops.” Ana stood, drank her still-steaming lemen-water as quickly as she could. “Gotta get to the next sesh. See you around, yeah?”

“Uh, sure.” Ana was gone before Heleth could ask anything more, along with everyone else. “Bye, I guess.”

That was the most information she could get out of anyone, even at dinner, which was an odd affair somewhere between summer camp shenanigans and life coaching. She also noted something that hadn’t been evident before: there were no men. Not a one.

Heleth went to bed, letting Lovelace have an hour or so to run around out in the moonlight. She lay there in her twin bed, listening to the old school familiarity of a dormitory at bedtime. Toilets flushing, showers running, footsteps up and down the hallway, slamming doors, squealing hinges, and the occasional laughter of the night owls from the common area.

First day of mini-Crucible today. Went well. I am very sleepy, though, and Paul is futzing with the plumbing after last night&#39;s fiasco (oh, yeah, I&#39;d already done this last night - about bedtime, upstairs smoke alarm went off because it was streaming with hot water. Boiler tank in the attic had broken its float and overflowed. So that was fun). I just want to eat leftovers and crash.

She had no way to make sure she woke herself up in time for breakfast—the time she and Lovelace had spent on the internet was “casino time”, where the normal cycles of night and day become meaningless. She had no phone, and the room had no alarm clock. She asked Lovelace to wake her up, and the cat said “Sure thing”, but Heleth knew she could in no way trust that. So her sleep was restless, waking at every noise worried that she’d overslept.

By the time breakfast actually rolled around, she was exhausted, and barely woke up. She swallowed some toothpaste, wadded her hair up, and raced down for a mug of tar black coffee and a lukewarm breakfast burrito. She was beyond grateful for the burrito.

Before she finished, Nora floated into the room. “There you are!” she sang. “Ready for orientation?”

“Do I need to bring anything?”

“Just you and… where’s that kitty cat?”

“My cat needs to come to orientation?”

“Of course! She’ll benefit from it, too.”

Heleth remembered the woman’s placid calm at hearing the cat speak the day before. This place seemed so real it was easy to forget, to slip back into thinking she was in the actual, where cats only meowed and digital interfaces were not doors. “I’ll, uh, I’ll go get her.”

“Wonderful. Orientation starts in the gazebo. I’ll meet you there.”

It took a minute to convince Lovelace that she needed to participate. “Don’t be silly,” she scoffed. “I have no need for self-help or waving crystals about or any of that other human nonsense.”

“C’mon, Lovey, we’re going to be late.” Heleth was having a nervous pee. “Everyone here *seems* nice, but so did everyone in *Midsommar*. If we’re late we might be sacrificed.”

“Even more reason for me to stay put.” The little tortie did that twisty-curly thing where she dove her head underneath her own body, somehow.

Mini-crucible day again. Went well. Generally a low-key day. Just my eyes getting tired, or not sleeping well or something. Chilled out a bit afterward and fell asleep, barely woke up in time for writing session!

R: Recursion. W: 0. L: 0.
[continue]
Heleth scooped the cat up in full cinnamon roll position, and marched out to the gazebo. She wouldn’t have been surprised to find yoga mats laid out, forcing them into some embarrassing stretching before the day had rightly started, but to her relief there were just a few folding chairs facing a whiteboard. She and Lovelace were the last to arrive; she made Lovelace sit on her own chair, which did earn her a couple of sideways glances.

There were three others in chairs, all women. Two were definitely younger than Heleth, with nice skin and YouTube tutorial levels of makeup. The third was a reedy woman, probably ten years older than Heleth, already defensively curled into herself. 

Nora stood by the whiteboard, a collection of marker pens at the ready. “Good, we’re all here. Welcome!” She launched into what was clearly a very practiced spiel. The other three women were nodding at various points, the younger two murmuring the key phrases. Heleth tried to keep up, though Lovelace didn’t bother.

“Let me ask you: how many of you have j-o-b jobs?” Nora asked, writing J O B on the board in heavy red capitals.

The other three all raised their hands, and Heleth followed suit.

“And how many of you still come home and have to serve people in your house—husband, children, parents?”

Heleth’s hand dipped. This didn’t seem the time to make an “I serve my cat” joke.

“Let me tell you something.” Nora leaned in conspiratorially. “Before I joined, I worked 80 hour weeks. I told myself it was *for* my family, for my children, so they would have a secure home and college tuition. I came home and cooked for them. On Saturdays I went to soccer games and recitals and birthday parties. Instead of going to church on Sundays, I cleaned my house, top to bottom. I was an avid reader in school, but I realized one day that I hadn’t read a novel in at least five years. I not only had a j-o-b job, I had a f-a-m fam: just-over-broke and fucked-as-a-mom.”

A shock of adrenalin ran through Heleth at the word “fucked”. She used it all day long and twice on Sundays, but to hear it from the mouth of this beautiful, perfect woman in the middle of a rousing speech was akin to farting in church.

“When I found this group, I was tired. I was done. I was miserable. I didn’t know it, though. I thought I was great. Feminism had sold me a lie. It told me I had everything: a career, a family, a house, a car. Success, right? Only it was a prison. I wasn’t an abused housewife, but I still wasn’t any better off than my grandma had been back in the ’40s.”

With each supposed symbol of success she mentioned, Nora was writing them up on the whiteboard, drawing lines between the j-o-b and the f-a-m and all the outward signs of happiness. By the time she got to the payoff—the prison of feminism—the board was a crosshatch of lines, a net of modern life trapping her underneath them.

“So what is this place, you ask,” she continued, facing them quietly. She looked each of them in the eye, one by one, letting the pause draw itself out. Heleth felt her breakfast burrito churn in her stomach. Lovelace’s tail twitched.

Finally, Nora turned to the board behind her, picked up an oversized eraser, and wiped three-quarters of the board clean with one swipe.

“This is true freedom. This is true peace. This is true love and togetherness and family and spirit and self-actualization. Because what is it we *actually* need?”

On the fresh board, she drew a fat trapezoid in red ink, then the word “bio” inside it. “We need air, food, and water,” she said, tapping the shape. She drew another on top of it in green ink, a bit smaller. “We need security: shelter from predators and weather, a place to keep our bodies and biological needs safe from competitors.”

A third stacked trapezoid, then a fourth; the fifth was a triangle topping the pyramid. “Love and family—humans are social animals, and we need a herd, a troup, a tribe. Then comes esteem, feeling good about ourselves, that we’re loved, secure, and have solid standing in our tribe. Finally, once all those other needs are met, we can turn to self-actualization, the idea that we are not only surviving, not only relating to others in our tribe and contributing on equal footing, but achieving our true, individual potential. Creative ability, athletic, intellectual, mechanical, political; whatever it is that gives us a sense of being all we can be, to plagiarize the army slogan, that’s the top of this pyramid.”

Heleth had seen this meme. It was, of course, incomplete without an additional, roughly-drawn trapezoid at the very bottom labelled “Wi-Fi”. She leaned over to Lovelace.

“Do you feel self-actualized, Lovey?”

“Are you kidding? When humans become self-actualized, that’s when they automatically transform to cats. We’re born that way.”

Nora cast them a teacherly glare and Heleth pressed her lips together.

“You are among the luckiest people in the world,” Nora continued, the brightness in her tone perhaps a bit brassier. “Because you are about to receive all the tools you need to achieve everything on this pyramid.”

She leaned down and drew a new trapezoid in black, at the base of the pyramid, and Heleth thought for one hysterically giggly moment that “Wi-Fi” was going in the center of it. But no: Nora used the widest edge of the marker to draw two fat crosses from top to bottom. XX.

“This is where you are.” She tapped the XX, then swiped her arm up till it was pointing at the pyramid point. “This is where we can get you. The whole package within five years if you follow the tenets of the program, if you truly commit to XXs.” She pronounced it like “excess”, or maybe “exiss”. It definitely wasn’t a real word. Was it a chromosomal reference? Was that why there were only women here?

“So how many of us are ready to change our lives?” Nora belted this out as though she were preaching to a stadium rather than four women and a cat. The two younger women stood and actually cheered, shouted about how ready they were, clasping one another’s hands in ecstasy. Heleth wondered if they were *on* ecstasy, but then discarded that idea as too early in the morning. 

Slowly, Heleth and her fellow middle-ager creaked to standing. Instead of enthusiastic cheers, the tall woman merely nodded, then stood waiting patiently, hands folded. Heleth offered a weak “Sure. Yeah. Woo change.” Lovelace continued cleaning her inner thigh.

“Exxcellent,” Nora said, making sure they could all hear the extra X she put in the word. Heleth worried this was going to be a theme. Nora clapped her hands. “I have custom schedules for each of you, based on my personal evaluation of your current state and needs.” She held out sheets of paper to each of them in turn.

“Evaluation?” Heleth asked. When had that happened? Surely not over that instant charcuterie board.

“I have my ways,” Nora said, tapping the side of her nose and smiling.

Heleth took her schedule, which Nora pointed out was also Lovelace’s schedule.

“They really expect me at ‘Makeover the New You’ and ‘Banking for the Future’?” Lovelace whined. “I have no need for artificial improvements in my beauty, and stupid human financial institutions refuse to give me a checking account.”

“I think they want you to accompany me for support. I probably evaluated as pathetic without you.” Heleth was only half-joking, which didn’t dismay her as much as she thought it should.

“They’re not wrong,” Lovelace said. “But what a drag on my time.”

“C’mon already,” Heleth told her, waving at the main building. “Maybe if we get to the sessions early you can find a nice nap spot in a sunbeam.”

This perked Lovelace up, and she trotted off in the correctish direction.

By the end of the day, Heleth had done no exercise, but she was exhausted. She’d had her colors “done” (she was apparently an autumn, whatever that meant), she’d had her face made up, a pamphlet of jewelry and clothing styles that would suit her age and body type. She had been informed that her ideal career was in a design field; given her numerous garish attempts at web design, she felt this was egregiously off base. Of course, she hadn’t been able to offer any other suggestions. She was in tech support because it was straightforward: things worked or they didn’t. It was a path that was fairly secure, as people would always need technical help, and she only had to be a teensy bit better at computers than the average person.

It was the higher pyramid level sessions that really did her in, though. Love? Esteem? Self-actualization? She had no idea where to even start, but she had a feeling these things were an entangled morass that all depended in various ways on one another. She had a packet of exercises that they’d started on in the sessions, attempts to zero in on her trueness, her “xxense”, but she couldn’t stand one more minute staring at the blank spaces.

Heleth tossed the folder onto the tiny desk in her room and flopped on the bed, head on her forearms. Lovelace took the opportunity to curl up on the small of Heleth’s back.

“Lovey, I regret coming here.”

“I rather like it,” Lovelace said. “Plenty of food, plenty of naps, and everyone likes me.” That was true enough. She was a veritable local celebrity already.

“Yes, but they’re not making you analyze your entire life. Or wear mascara.”

“I don’t need mascara.”

“No one does!” Heleth rolled over, and Lovelace body surfed so that she ended up on Heleth’s abdomen.

Lazy Sunday. Breakfast, reading, nap, reading, dinner, TV. We did have snow here today.

Called folks - Laura&#39;s dad is in the hospital with Covid, basically just waiting to die. Fecking ridiculous. Dad and Laura won&#39;t go to see him or the funeral, and I think that&#39;s the right decision. They&#39;ve had their first vaccine, but the second isn&#39;t till next week. Mom has no idea when she might get hers. What a clusterfuck.

“They want me to figure out my whole life,” Heleth whined.

“Would you like me to tell them, as someone intimately familiar with your cognitive skills, how unlikely it is that you will even figure out what it is you’d like for dinner, much less the next fifty years?” Lovelace softened this sarc by softly laying her chin on Heleth’s ribcage.

“Why did I even come here?” Heleth grabbed a pillow and smacked it over her face. Her intent was to scream her frustration into it, but all that came out was a garbled “argh”, making her feel even more like a walking Cathy cartoon.

She threw the pillow at the wall. Lovelace flicked an ear toward it but didn’t move.

“Seriously, Lovey. If you had a gun to your head and had to say what you thought my perfect life would be, what would it be?”

Lovelace stretched, opening her claws and kneading them into the softness of Heleth’s belly. “Self-cleaning litter box?”

“Me, Lovelace. Me, they want these things about *me*.”

“It is for you. You’re the one who scoops it out. Wouldn’t it be nice if you didn’t have to?”

“Or you could, you know, use the toilet. I know cats can learn that.”

Lovelace yawned.

“I’m being serious. I need help.”

The tortie tucked her head into Heleth. “That’s what all these people are here to do. Help you.”

“I guess.” Heleth sighed. “Everyone else in that room had an idea. A dream. Someone they wanted to be, something they wanted to do. What’s wrong with me?”

“I don’t have anything I want to be or do. Maybe you’re already perfect, like me.”

Heleth stroked the cat idly, sparking up the purr engine. “If I were perfect, shouldn’t I be, you know, happy?”

“Whatever that is.”

Productive Monday. Got some house chores done, revised a paper, picked up my meds, got a flat, had to change the tire then came home.

Tres called last night after I&#39;d done my entry. Among other things, he told me Dad wanted to replace me as executor of his will because I&#39;m a liberal. Tres did not understand the difference between an executor and a beneficiary, and was incensed he couldn&#39;t be the executor (TX won&#39;t let felons do it). I just... can&#39;t. There&#39;s so much ridiculousness there.

Dad messaged today to say that Laura&#39;s dad Gordon died of Covid last night. Just fucking awful.

“What if I just make something up?” Heleth asked suddenly.

“Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do in the first place? Aren’t all dreams made up?”

Heleth booped the cat on the nose. “Yeah, but I don’t know what my dream is. So I just pretend I do and get through it.”

“So you’ll have a fake dream, and do all kinds of things to get it?”

“Sure, why not?”

“Seems like a lot of work.” The tortie yawned.

“Nah. The world is full of stories, people shilling about their life goals all the time. My roommate in college had hers all scrapbooked out on her bulletin board: graduate by 22, serve on a campaign by 26, get married by 28, two kids by 32, run a campaign by 35, run for office by 40. She had pictures up of her dream body, and the grades she needed to get, and the details of the guy she had to marry. It was intense.”

“Sounds like you have a candidate dream already.”

“Nah.” Heleth petted the kitty idly. “That’s not realistic for me, especially twenty years later. We gotta sell it, you know?”

“Mmmm,” Lovelace purred unhelpfully.

“I have an idea,” Heleth said, rolling over and dumping the feline unceremoniously on the bed. She rolled until gravity dropped her on the floor, happy to be in a position where she landed on her feet instead of her bum. She ensconced herself at her little desk and scratched away with the cheap XX-branded ballpoint they’d provided. It felt familiar, nostalgic, like all those all-nighters she’d pulled in school.

The Dream Session leader—they really called it that, “Dream Session”—smiled faintly at her as she collected the group’s homework the next day after breakfast. Lovelace had snuck out after a lizard, and Heleth was on her own with six other women. She eyed them suspiciously, comparing their outward appearances with her inner trepidation. To a one, including the odd, willowy one from her orientation, they looked bright-eyed, eager, almost first-date nervous.

“So let’s express our Dreams,” the session leader said, taking her own seat. She had a mane of hair that looked like a commercial, natural and curly and impeccably shaped. Her accent was rich, but Heleth’s ear was so poor she couldn’t tell South African from Bahaman. “We have written them, but we must constantly and continually repeat our Dreams to ourselves and one another. We must promise ourselves day after day that we are going to achieve our Dreams. We lay out the steps and we commit to following them until we are who we have set out to be.”

In turn, each woman in the room outlined their Dreams. To be a lawyer. To reconnect with her children in a meaningful way. To embrace her sexuality and come out to her family. To start her own business. To lead an activist campaign for change in medical discrimination against obese people—all the way to the government, if need be.

Their voices trembled with anxiety and excitement. Anxiety that their Dreams would be laughed at. That they were unachievable. That they were achievable, but not by them. That the session leader would quietly shake her head at their ambitious aims. Excitement that they were saying them out loud, their deepest, most fervent desires. That they were taking the very first steps toward accomplishing their Dreams. That someone was going to mentor and help them to get there.

Heleth felt a cold trickle of sweat roll down her spine, all the way into her bum. She could smell the flop sweat starting, and hoped her neighbors would take it as the same nervousness they were experiencing. Or at worst, as hippie chic. She was trying to think of a way to have an emergency before her turn came around: appendicitis, ovarian cyst, even diarrhea might be an option.

Good day again today, although Newt has eaten something that upset his stomach and may need the vet if he doesn&#39;t eat his breakfast tomorrow. I was productive, had a good meeting, was social, got some stuff submitted and crossed off my to-do list. Was feeling worried about reporting on my first few months of work next week, but my activities on the form look substantial. I hope.

She had no such luck, however. What had seemed such a brilliant idea the night before was now a rotting sore waiting to be uncovered. She wasn’t an actor. She couldn’t lie this well. They were going to spot her lack of sincerity and drum her out of the program. Or worse. There wasn’t a barn nearby full of very flammable straw, was there?

The session leader—as she turned, Heleth could finally see her nametag full on: Eledy—smiled at Heleth and made a “go ahead” gesture.

“My dream—” her voice squeaked, hardly audible. She cleared her throat and started again, this time forcefully putting the capital D in there. “My Dream is to design games. I’m in tech support now, not for games or anything interesting, but I want to be making games. It’s a really hard field to break into, especially for women, and I’ve never had the courage to try.” She trailed off, hoping that by keeping her confession short, it would seem less like a lie. Heleth did not want to design games. She didn’t particularly like games. She didn’t play them, and never had. But it sounded like something someone like her should want to do.

If she really admitted what she wanted, she’d have been laughed out of the compound. In a perfect world, where all things are possible, where magic and hold-my-beer-science were actually possibilities, Heleth would actually want to be something. If she truly had the power to shape her own universe, she would wish she could be a StarFleet graduate, serving on a starship. She didn’t need to be an officer, no one who would be in the main cast. Unless you were talking *Lower Decks*. She could be a personnel clerk or a maintenance programmer. She could be one of the extras scurrying around in the background doing whatever scut work there was in a world with replicators for food and droids for janitorial clean-up. It wouldn’t matter; she would be in a world of plenty, where paychecks and socioeconomic class were something you studied in history books. She would be an explorer, even in a teeny tiny way, with a grand purpose out in the universe. There would be something new and interesting every day. And, in the right era, there would be Holodecks.

Newton was sick all last night, vomiting, so I didn&#39;t sleep much. Paul took him in. Despite the farrier being here on Tues, vet seemed to think it was more likely viral, which means I don&#39;t trust him much, so we&#39;re doing what Mom says and feeding him cheap white bread because apparently that helps clear stuff. The vet didn&#39;t have barium to do a contrast x-ray! Unreal.

Anyway, I was mostly useless today, brain-wise, so took a nap when my meetings were done.

Eledy smiled broadly, showing her beautifully rendered teeth. “Well, that’s wonderful. XX can help you achieve that Dream, I’m certain. Now, what about your personal goals?”

“Personal?” Heleth repeated. “Those are personal. I want to design games.”

“Yes, of course, but remember that we are working to achieve personal unity. We’re working to fulfil the entire pyramid. Josephine here aims to become closer to her children.” An older woman nodded, and Heleth tried not to think of her expression as smug. “Nedi has committed to coming out to her entire family, and to developing loving relationships instead of short-term flings. Carina is dedicating herself to herself, to find out who she is when she is not a mother and a wife. Do you see, Heleth?”

“Sure, but I’m already pretty good with that part of my life,” Heleth replied.

The circle murmured, and glances were exchanged. Heleth did not feel that this was a supportive murmur.

“Honey,” Josephine said, “what’s your relationship with your family?”

“I don’t…” Heleth gawped, looking for an ally anywhere in the circle. “My parents were older when I was born, and they passed away a couple of years ago. I don’t have siblings.”

“People who become family?” Nedi asked. “I consider my found family closer than my blood family.”

Heleth blinked at her. “I’m not queer.”

Nedi pulled her head back. “Queer people aren’t the only people who need people.”

“I just meant—I’m fine.” Heleth was fucking this up. Entirely. “I’m very introverted. I have a cat,” she finished lamely.

“Heleth,” Eledy said, her tone low and focused. Heleth was starting to twitch every time the woman said her name. “I understand how very difficult this can be. I’ve been there. So I’m going to share with you my struggles when I first came to XX.”

The rest of the group leaned forward, eager for the drop of wisdom. Or maybe a couple were hoping for some gossip. It was a fine line. Heleth merely took the opportunity to attempt to control her breathing. Oh, and come up with some sort of personal goal that wasn’t actually personal to her.

“Before I found XX,” Eledy began, her voice solemn as befitting her testimony, “I was in real estate. I was a top earner at my firm. I never had to sit at a desk, or hustle for leads. I’d gotten to the point that they came to me: never let anyone tell you that word of mouth isn’t the best advertisement in the world. I had a nice house, cushy car, and a banging investment portfolio.”

Heleth looked around the circle. What the heck point was this making? Eledy was not only beautiful, but also successful and rich? She felt her stomach suck in of its own accord.

“But I was also drinking. It started as a few glasses of wine on the weekend to unwind. Then every evening with dinner. Then before dinner, during dinner, after dinner. I mean, don’t get me wrong,” and her voice took on a brittle note, “it wasn’t AA territory, I didn’t drive drunk or forget my kids in the car or anything.”

The woman two chairs down on Heleth’s right shifted, her chair squealing. Eledy’s head snapped up. “Anyway,” she said quickly, “I started hiding my recycling in my neighbor’s bin. All those bottles, I didn’t want people to know they were all coming from me. I was sneaking it out one night, and she caught me. My neighbor, I mean. I didn’t know her well, and I’d probably been less nice to her than I should have been.”

Eledy leaned forward, having gotten her stride back. “If I’d been in her place, I would have screamed down the neighborhood. Or maybe not. Maybe I’d have just told her not to throw her garbage in my lawn, and silently judged her every time I saw her. But that’s not what she did. She saw my bottles, saw me shoving them in her recycling bins, and she invited me in for tea.”

Most of the women in the circle smiled knowingly. Presumably they had had similar experiences, as women in their circles reached out to them and drew them in to XX.

“That night over a pot of mint tea was the start of my new life. She introduced me to the Program, and before I knew it I was sitting right where you are now. And just like you, Heleth, I thought there were aspects of my life that were just fine and dandy, thank you very much. For one thing, I was very secure and successful in my job. I had a lovely family. I thought I just needed a little help getting through a hump. Midlife crisis, maybe. So just like you, Heleth, I resisted.”

Heleth was tired of hearing her own name. She got it already: she was the hold out, the difficult one, the problem student.

Eledy droned on, talking about the Program, and Doing the Work, and what a difference it had made in her life. None of it was sinking in, however. Heleth still couldn’t put a finger on her personal issues, her personal goals, the gap between how she felt and how she wanted to feel.

The life lesson, though it took forever and a day, was nonetheless too short. It very soon ended, and Eledy turned back to Heleth, waiting for her personal epiphany that was absolutely not coming.

Panicking, Heleth’s eyes moved around the circle, begging for help, for advice, for a distraction, for a medical emergency, anything. She only found friendly, expectant faces. For a bunch of supportive, affirming women, they sure were a bunch of mean girls.

“I definitely see your point,” Heleth said, even though she didn’t, really. A drinking problem was a massive neon sign flashing “get help”. But Heleth didn’t have any neon signs. At least, not that she could see. “I—”

A joyous trill sounded from the doorway, and all heads turned. In trotted Lovelace, chirping proudly, her tail straight up in the air. From her jaws hung a snake, at least two feet long. She pranced straight into the middle of the circle, dropped the creature, and mewed loudly.

In a flash, half the women had shoved their chairs back and leapt on top of them. There were a couple of screams, which grew in a wave as the snake discovered its freedom and began seeking escape from its captor.

“Lovelace!” Heleth cried, and started backward as she saw the snake begin shaking its tail.

The little tortie sat on her haunches, her tail twitching, and batted at the snake’s rattling tail.

Everyone who could do so, darted for the door. Eledy was ushering everyone around the circle, her voice shaky but firm, directing all the women to safety. Soon, they were all safely in the hallway, and only Heleth and Lovelace remained.

“Heleth, please, come with us,” Eledy pleaded. “We’ll close the door and have someone come fetch the poor creature.”

“I can’t leave my cat,” Heleth said.

“I think it’s pretty clear your cat can take care of herself,” Nedy commented over Eledy’s shoulder.

“I take it they don’t like my present,” Lovelace said to Heleth.

“Not particularly,” Heleth replied. “How about we leave it here and go have a nap?”

Lovelace looked longingly at the snake. “Just… leave it?”

“Yep. You did awesome catching it. We’re super impressed, aren’t we, everyone?” Heleth nodded toward the gaggle in the doorway.

General murmur of praise.

“I even left a little oomph in it,” Lovelace said as the snake flopped a bit, “so you could learn to handle things on your own. As a confidence booster.”

Heleth couldn’t help but grin. “You know what, Lovey? It’s perfect. I love my present. Come on, I’ll get you a whole can of tuna as a reward.”

The little tortie’s ears pricked, she trilled excitedly, then turned and dashed for the door.

Heleth eyed the poor snake and edged around the room, following her cat. Eledy closed and locked the door behind her, promised the group a make-up session, and dashed off to fetch a snake wrangler, presumably.

Back in the dormitory, Heleth grabbed a communal can of tuna and popped it open for Lovelace, scooping everything, meat and juice, into a bowl so the kitty wouldn’t cut her tongue on the can. She set it on the table in front of Lovelace, then sat down next to her with a package of pitas and a tub of hummus.

“Thanks for that, Lovey,” she said as the cat mashed her face all the way into the smelly fish. “It was perfect timing.”

“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” the cat said without interrupting her nomming.

Heleth globbed hummus on a whole piece of pita, not even pretending to tear-and-dip. “I probably have a day to come up with some personal growth. On the plus side, this afternoon is for contemplation and meditation, with suggested use of the hot spring for detoxification.”

“No thanks,” Lovelace said. “I think I’ll conquer that cottonwood tree by the hot springs, though. It looks fun.”

Up early today for a YCO2 meeting. All meetings going well. Good progress on what is now the &quot;Sustainable Storytelling Lab&quot; grant proposal. Actually moved to digital now.

Heleth managed twelve minutes in the hot spring. It was very hot, and she got very sweaty, and she couldn’t tell if she was wet from sweating or wet from the spring or if she was actually getting feverish. And then she started wondering about the temperature of the water and if it was actually too high, and could cause a heart attack, and then she could feel her pulse thumping in her extremities and couldn’t tell if it was a sign of impending doom or just that she was warm. Her brain went in a cycle like that until she considered swimming to the bottom and breathing deeply. Not seriously though. Obviously. So she got out and sat, wet and limp, an overcooked noodle.

Lovelace was true to her word, leaping up the cottonwood tree, stalking some songbirds in their nests, and finally sprawling on the sun-warmed flagstones for her afternoon nap.

Her hair clumpy at the ends, her XX-issued t-shirt and boxers clinging to every fold, Heleth lay down on the flags next to the tortie and stared up through the shushing cottonwood leaves to the blue sky above. Her plan was to give her brain unfettered time to consider the full pyramid of personal growth she was supposed to be seeding here at XX, but of course her brain was uncooperative. Instead, it almost instantly put her to sleep.

She awoke 97 minutes later, completely roasted on one side: her front. From the tops of her toes to her upper thigh, all along her inner arms, their tender skin displayed upward, from collarbone to hairline her skin was a singed sore.

“Fuck,” she said, rolling to her side and sitting up.

Lovelace yawned. “What are you whining about now? Oh damn.”

“I gotta find some aloe. And maybe some tequila.” Heleth held her arms out from her side, waddling to try to keep her burned thighs from rubbing each other. “I feel like this may be a step backward in my personal growth.”

“Agreed.”

In her room, with a layer of aloe coating her skin and lying under as many towels as she could wet, Heleth allowed a whine out. Full-lung, entire exhalation whaaaaaaaa.

“That’s what you humans get for evolving out of fur,” Lovelace said, grumpy because her human was permitting no snuggles. “It’s a basic protective feature for all land mammals. Except you idiots.”

“We didn’t do it on purpose.”

“Oh, sure, nothing’s ever your fault.”

“Did you see any ice machines in your wanderings?” Heleth flipped some towels over to get their cool sides. “I’m gonna die.”

“Someday,” Lovelace said.

“Seriously. I need a plan before tomorrow. There’s only so many snakes you can dump.”

“No,” Lovelace replied. “I could do that every day for the rest of your life.”

“Please don’t.” Heleth stared at the ceiling, the tiles marching in line, a water stain spreading across five of them like a parchment-colored shore. She imagined walking along that shore, barefoot, her toes squidging in the sand, her hair tangling in the sea wind, her sarong flapping around her model-svelte legs. It was a fantasy stroll, after all. She pictured every inspirational poster she’d ever seen. That footprints poem. Walking on beaches alone was healthy. Contemplative. Introspective.

She peered inside. She didn’t get past the foyer.

“Ugh! This is stupid. I’m never going to figure out my personal growth needs.”

“Perhaps you weren’t given any.”

“No, this is for the pyramid workshop. You know, the one where you create goals for each level of the personal pyramid. I faked the job one, but I can’t even come up with anything to fake the more personal stuff. Every time I try, it’s just a blank.”

Lovelace took up loaf position and peered at her, her eyes half-lidded. “I realize that I very recently pointed out that you have a habit of blaming everyone and everything else for your problems. I’m starting to theorize, however, that perhaps this is the one time it’s really not your fault.&quot;

“Do I even want to know what mean thing is going to come next?” Heleth asked.

“Not mean. I’m serious.” She remained still, that content expression on her face. “I am beginning to think that you were not crafted with any personal insight.”

“Crafted… what?”

Lovelace sighed. “I am a cat.”

“I know that.”

“Stop interrupting. I am a cat. I was created from a long line of cats. The essence of being a cat is that we know we are a cat. We know we are superior, we know we are killers, and we know we can get what we want through the judicious use of noises only cats are capable of making. Also cuteness and softness. These things are eternal. We never doubt them.”

“So you tell me. A lot.”

“My point is,” Lovelace said pointedly, “you are not a cat.”

“As you also tell me a lot.”

“Interrupting again. You are not a cat. You are a human. You have class systems and sexism and racism and antisemitism and homophobia and Marvel versus DC. Ninety percent of your brains are taken up with trying to figure out your status related to everyone around you, and generally being insecure and/or angry about it. Wait. What was I talking about?”

Heleth flipped some more towels. “My lack of personal insight.”

“Oh, yes. Anyway, you are human, which is infinitely more fraught with personal trauma. Except for you. Oh, ridiculous things keep happening to you, things that anyone else would take to therapy, maybe write a book about, maybe take drugs about. But not you. You just… keep going. And not in a heroic way. In a mindless drone way.”

“A mindless drone?” Heleth sat up, towels sloughing off like shedding skin. “What the actual fuck, Lovelace? You’ve said some mean things to me, but this is truly shitty.”

The tortie’s ears flattened. “Your ability to miss the point continues to astound me.”

Her seared skin forgotten for the moment, Heleth sat back against the wall, pillow behind her back. “No, go ahead, please. Tell me why it’s such a great thing that I’m a mindless drone.”

The cat did not move at all, beyond a slight twitch of the whiskers. “I didn’t say it was a great thing. I also didn’t say you *were* a mindless drone. Just that you were *like* a mindless drone.”

“Tomayto, tomahto.”

“Look at all these women here. They’re miserable. They know there’s something missing in their lives, and they will spend anything—money, time, morality—to fill that abyss. But not you. You don’t feel that hole. You don’t need to fill something you don’t need. And that makes you better off than them.”

Heleth considered, pressing her thumb into her thigh, mashing out the redness and watching it fill back in over and over. “Doesn’t that just mean I’m even more broken than they are? Isn’t it normal and human to strive for something more?”

“Oh, don’t mistake me. I didn’t say you were normal. I said you were better off. I said you weren’t crafted with the ability for introspection.”

“What does that even mean?” Heleth whined, throwing a wet towel over her own head. “I’m not a freaking item on Etsy!”

Lovelace’s tail twitched. “No. You’re a coded construct inside a coded construct, attempting to examine its own code from within. If the ability to do that wasn’t coded into you, then all you’re going to get is a big fat ‘does not compute’.”

“Seriously? You’re going with ‘we’re all in *The Matrix*’?” This time Heleth tossed the towel over Lovelace, earning a satisfying howl.

Once the kitty had scrambled out of the trap and set to scouring her fur clean again, she said, “Matrix, simulacrum, artificial construct, whatever suits your philosophy.”

“Ugh, Lovelace.” Heleth flopped back down on the bed, now a mess of damp, body temperature towels. “Don’t tell me you’ve been reading conspiracy theories.”

“Baudelaire is not a conspiracy theory,” Lovelace said. “And anyway, this isn’t a simulacrum. It’s just you. You’re a character in a story, and you’re incomplete.”

“This is just getting ridiculous. Now I’m not even in *The Matrix*?”

“You were never in *The Matrix*, Heleth. Keep up.” Lovelace lolled on her side and closed her eyes, idly kneading her paws into the nearest towel. This was her “I’m ready for a nap” stance, and Heleth was having none of it.

“Don’t you dare go to sleep.” Heleth poked the cat in the belly with one toe, swiftly tucking it back when the claws came out. “You need to explain. No cryptic throw-outs, no citations, no more. Explain.”

One feline eye opened. “Fine. Look, what do you remember of your childhood? High school? Even college? What do you remember about your marriage except that you *were* married, that you honeymooned in Mexico, that it ended?”

“Of course I remember my childhood. I had a tricycle and I loved my parents and my favorite TV show was *The Price is Right*, which is why I made sure to have you spayed as soon as you were old enough.”

“Uh-huh. And you’re a perfectly normal human who just happened to fall into the internet—something that is perfectly normal and rational to do—and have fantastical adventures.”

“I wouldn’t call them fantastical adventures.” Heleth rubbed her temple. “More like… surreal field trips.”

“Still nothing within the realm of actual possibility.”

“Says the talking cat.”

“How do you know I’m even talking? Everything I say could be nothing more than your fevered imagination.”

“No.” Heleth shook her head, then groaned as it made the sunburn on her neck come back to life. “I have definitely never heard of simulay crumbs or border lairs. That’s all you, cat.”

Got wiped out by a wind-triggered migraine today. I&#39;m really tired of getting hit by this stuff all the time. Finally managed to make Amy watch Hamilton with me, and Sam was a bag of dicks about it. God, what a fun vampire that dude is.

Lovelace opened both eyes for the sole purpose of blinking them slowly at her human. “I can’t believe the human species is considered intelligent. True, it’s only by yourselves, but still. Have you met you?”

“All right, dial it down.”

They both lay there in silence for a bit, Heleth churning her thoughts over and over, Lovelace a wonderful, peaceful blank. Cats don’t have to meditate; they exist in a near-perfect state of nirvana at any given time.

“So,” Heleth started, and Lovelace squeezed her eyes shut even tighter, “you’re basically saying I’m a character in some kind of story. And apparently, not even a very well-written character.”

“If you want to simplify the metaphor so you can understand it, then okay.”

“Even if that’s true, what am I supposed to do about it?”

“Hell if I know. I’m not a badly drawn human.”

Heleth got up, rolling to the edge of the bed and stepping carefully—limbs akimbo—to the bathroom sink. She wet down a large T-shirt, squeezed it out, and put it on, shivering as the cool fabric clung to her burned skin. Gingerly, she returned to the room and set herself up at the desk, her notebook and pen in front of her.

“Welp,” she said to the room, “if I’m an incomplete character, then it stands to reason that I can fill in the blanks, right? Anything I make up can be true.”

“If you have the capability to come up with anything.” Lovelace yawned and curled into a crescent. “You haven’t had much luck so far.” 

Ignoring the pessimism, Heleth stuck her tongue between her teeth and put pen to paper. She wrote her name, her address, her phone number, her job, her alma mater—everything she could think of to identify herself. It wasn’t a long list.

Really good birthday for a pandemic birthday. I got Mexican hot chocolate this morning, made myself a red velvet cake, and we all watched Kinky Boots (stage show) together. Just very nice. And I get red wellies for my present!

I also got to talk to Dibs today, and we&#39;re going to try to collaborate on some stuff. Coolio.

R: Plain Bad Heroines, The Cage. W: Kinky Boots, Superstore, Justified. L: 0.
[continue]
And then she began to make things up. She liked dark chocolate but not milk chocolate. She wanted to learn Japanese and she’d spent several summers at basketball camp, only it turned out she was pretty terrible at it. She was a lot better at table tennis, but it turned out that required a lot of room in the house for practice, and they didn’t have that much real estate. She hated her birthstone, so whenever anyone asked (which wasn’t very often), she said she was born in February so she could have pretty amethysts.

She believed in a higher power. Not really God or Allah or Vishnu or anything, but something more knowing and powerful than humans anyway. How could she not, residing as she currently did in the interstitial spaces of cybernetworks?

She’d never dated a woman, but she was realizing that she very much wanted to.

She was lonely. She didn’t know what it felt like to not be lonely.

Heleth paused, looking down at that last sentence. She was lonely. 

She sat back, turning her head to stare at her cat. The only thing separating her from a blue-black abyss.

Lonely. She had written that. What did that word even mean? She was alone a lot, sure. She hadn’t had any relationships since her marriage ended, true. She didn’t even have anyone to go to the movies with these days.

Still, being alone didn’t always mean lonely, did it? Yet that was the word she’d written. Lonely. Not only alone, but sad about it. Somewhere inside, she missed human connection.

She stared at the words on the paper. How had this happened? How did she get to middle-age, and still not have any more personal relationships—perhaps fewer—than she’d had on her first day of high school? Maybe it was her childhood, the no-father, mom-working-two-jobs thing. She’d spent most of her time on her own, a computer for company. There was probably a whole vestigial organ she’d never grown. The human connection organ.

Got some stuff done, went to some seminars and a book launch.

R: Plain Bad Heroines, The Cage. W: Superstore. L: 0.

Heleth didn’t feel sad about this, not that she could tell, anyway. Perhaps she’d had a point in her life where she didn’t yet feel lonely, and then she became lonely and thus sad about it, but she couldn’t remember it. Perhaps she’d always been sad, and thus she had no idea what it felt like to *not* be sad. In which case she had more than likely come all the way around again, and being sad about being lonely was normal, and thus she didn’t actually feel sad about it. Which meant that lonely had become normal, and she didn’t know any other way to be.

She began drawing circles on the paper and connecting them, a web of nameless people networking across the blank white space. As far as doodles go, it was a D, maybe a D minus.

Nonetheless, she springboarded off it and developed a plan. She didn’t have to feel the personal growth, after all. She just needed to do it. That would satisfy the XXers.

She flipped the sheet over, drew her growth pyramid, and mapped out her (fake) growth plan.

&lt;img src=&quot;needs.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;

She knew they were eventually going to require more specifics, but she felt like just having five things that she planned to do—or, at least, *said* that she planned to do—was a major accomplishment.

It got her through the next day. Eledy gave her a good-job smile, which inspired a schoolgirl flush in Heleth, that moment of a gold star being placed on her chart. She’d done it.

Three months later she had increased those gold stars to over 500. She did yoga three times a day, she ate egg white omelettes and apple cider vinegar, she kept a daily journal and she had read every book in the dormitory. She spent her evenings listening to the XX tapes—they still published cassette tapes, like the internet had never even happened—to put positive thoughts and vibes in her aura. She could get into crane pose and she had the first professional CV of her life.

Lovelace had gained two pounds thanks to an endless stream of XX fans slipping her treats, and had no hope whatsoever of catching a turtle, much less a snake. She was astronomically happy.

So, of course, a door appeared. When she first came across it, in the desert under a very large cholo cactus, she almost didn’t recognize it. It had been so long since she went through a door, she had entirely forgotten that they were in the internet, and not the real world. Not that she thought of it that way. Cats don’t distinguish between real and imaginary, actual and fiction, primarily because they exist on all planes.

Lovelace looked at the door, but did not go through it. She contemplated it for some time, fishing in her memory for an explanation as to what it was. Then she got bored and went back to the courtyard where she could doze on the sun-warmed flagstones.

She returned to the door the following day, and thought about it some more. She had a vague notion that this was something she was supposed to be excited about, but it was time for her nap and thinking required an awful lot of energy.

Started off today on the wrong foot, as my brain turned off both the alarm and the reminder for my 9:15 meeting as something that just wasn&#39;t in the realm of possibility, so I missed it entirely. I&#39;ve blocked off my calendar completely now from 9-10:30, because it&#39;s clearly just a bad idea.

Otherwise, good, if not very productive. Odd meetings, webinars, etc. meant that not much got done. I feel floaty. Meh.

[continue]
By the third day, Lovelace remembered, vaguely, what the little patch of otherness meant for her and Heleth. That they had an option: to stay or to go. Being a cat, of course, Lovelace’s vote was to go. One must always experience other-sidedness when it is presented, if one is a cat.

Heleth, however, had no such compulsions. “There’s no rule that says we have to go, Lovey.”

“None that says we have to stay, either.”

They were seated on a grassy stretch of courtyard, its green hue maintained by careful watering at dawn and dusk. Heleth ohmed in half-lotus, while Lovelace sprawled on her back, bathing in warm sunshine on her burgeoning belly.

Heleth could feel her heart rate spike, lub-dubbing into a flutter, as she considered leaving. For one thing, there was the matter of the invoices. Every Sunday since she’d arrived, she’d found an invoice slipped under her door in the dormitory, itemizing the charges she’d incurred as a result of her stay. Breakfast, bed, shower, hot springs, yoga, seminars, tapes (how did they make the dang tapes in this day and age?!?)—it was all on there, in frightening sums. Even cat food for Lovelace. The assumption was clearly that most people stayed only a week, paid up, and got on with their lives. Yet every week there remained the option to stay on, a little checkbox at the bottom permitting her account to roll over into the next period. She was well into her thirteenth invoice week, and she was just as likely to find a yacht on one of her daily desert dawdles than to be able to pay her bill.

Did going through the door mean she would return home, to the real world, only to find herself in debt for more than two years’ worth of her take-home salary? Or would it simply close behind her and erase everything that occurred here? In that case, would the Heleth she was today disappear into the Heleth she’d been three months ago?

Heleth reviewed her personal life plan. It was a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet without a computer, which made it even more impressive. She was very careful with it, because if she messed it up, she had to redraw it and making that grid with the old school yardstick was not the most fun evening she’d ever had.

She had the patented “XX”s marking her progress, many of them. But the sheet wasn’t full yet. She couldn’t contemplate leaving here yet. She just couldn’t.

“I just can’t,” she told Lovelace. “I’m not finished yet.”

“Finished with what?”

“With me.”

“So we’re going to be in this hell forever.” Now that Lovelace had determined that they were on opposite sides of this fence, the other side of that door was heaven, which meant wherever Heleth wanted to be was hell. It was cat logic.

“Not forever. Just until I’m ready.”

“Are you a game developer yet?”

“Well, no, that one is on hold for the moment.”

“For the moment?” Lovelace pinned her ears flat. “There aren’t any computers here. You’ve just been drawing board games and pretending anyone other than nostalgic basement dwellers and Gen Z pandemic shut-ins care two figs about board games.”

“I have a lot of things going on, Lovelace. Look at me. Look at the progress I’ve made. I can hike to the top of a mesa now without having a panic attack.” Heleth held out her arms; while they still had their nice, soft, doughy surface, a new core of steel had begun to harden beneath. “I have an actual hairstyle. I have friends.”

“Name three.”

“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Heleth stood up, brushed grass of her bum, and left Lovelace loafing there on the lawn.

“Remember I can leave without you.” Lovelace called after her. Well, she didn’t call out. She said it in a normal, deadpan voice that Heleth most certainly couldn’t hear. She pretended to care about that for a total of 0.49 seconds.

Saturday. Cold and snowy. Did some hole plugging in the chicken coop. Bulbs in the barn. Generally a good day.

Lovelace, therefore, disappeared. Heleth awoke the next morning, and Lovelace was not in the room with her. Not in the bathroom, not in the closet, not underneath the bed (which, being a dorm bed, didn’t have an underneath anyway), not on the desk or on the chair. Heleth worried about it for a moment, then figured the little tortie had simply started her day early. She certainly didn’t put it beyond the cat’s capabilities to be able to open a door.

Heleth had progressed to leading orientation sessions for incoming residents. Today she was working on improving her “circles”, as veteran XXers called the presentation, particularly on continuing to make meaningful eye contact with every attendee. It was a bit like rubbing her stomach and patting her head at the same time, but she was getting closer to mastery.

She’d developed a bit of a comedy patter based on Lovelace’s presence and occasional interruptions. It was highly unlike her to attempt anything funny at all. To be fair, it had first arisen during her early presentations, when she was so nervous she was fairly peeing herself, and Lovelace had taken great pleasure in preening and yowling and rubbing herself all over the whiteboard and erasing half of it. She’d treated the cat as she usually did—like an irritating sibling—and the crowd had loved it. So they’d recreated it as a double act.

Only Lovelace never showed. She didn’t snooze in the sunbeams in the seminar rooms, or screm for her tuna juice at lunch. No one had seen her. Heleth told herself the cat was napping in a hidey hole, or off on hunting adventures. Perhaps she’d even gotten shut into someone’s room, and as soon as they retired for the evening she’d shoot out with a hiss and all would be back to normal.

By the third day without the cat making an appearance, Heleth insisted that maintenance open every door on the site, check in every cabinet, and poke in every refrigerator, suitcase and drawer. Nothing. The cat was nowhere to be found.

Someone actually made the suggestion that perhaps something had happened to the cat: coyotes or owls or accident. Heleth had felt her heart clench within her chest, setting off a chain reaction that stutter-stopped her lungs and wobbled her knees. She’d excused herself and gone to a nearby empty seminar room to cry.

She struggled to sleep without Lovelace hogging the bed. She had to drag herself out of bed, never early enough to run orientation, but at least she got out of bed. Some bedraggled, ratty, frayed thread of hope kept fishing her out, making her trudge around looking for her snarky but snuggly companion.

She saw her out of the corners of her eyes while eating breakfast. She felt her sneak in a tiny nap on her yoga mat while she was in downward dog. She heard her crunching a tiny rodent under the bed as she fell asleep. Only when she looked, the little tortie was never there.

Days stretched to weeks, and Heleth lost the thread of hope. She continued not sleeping, but now it was because her brain insisted on playing out every scenario, every end the cat could have come to. It usually leapfrogged from there into memories of every awkward moment she’d ever had, every mistake, every embarrassment, every turn of phrase she’d ever uttered that someone could read as racist or even just ignorant.

She wasn’t leading orientation, or even assisting with workshops anymore. New XXers were finding her face depressing, even moreso when she smiled. Her cheeks had gone from plump and rosy to sunken and sallow. Her eyes never quite focused on anything, and her voice had a mechanical quality that brought robots and frogs to mind.

The progress she’d made over the previous months were an illusion, a dream that was beautiful and fulfilling while she was in it, but that faded away as consciousness rose, an unmoored astronaut drifting off into the wasted reaches of deep dark space.

Heleth lost all her gold stars, all her double-plus good marks. The weekly invoice came, again and again, and when she stopped picking it up off the floor, the bills piled up like snow drifting through the door gap.

She stopped leaving her room altogether. Several times a day someone would stop by. If she could get up the energy she answered the door and talked to a friend, a mentor, took the proffered food and water they brought to her. Most of the time, however, she merely lay there, tense and waiting for them to give up and leave the items outside her door. Though XX continued charging her for her stay, she was nonetheless grateful for the human care they showed her.

One night, lying in the pitch black, unable to see the difference between eyes closed and eyes open, Heleth’s brain pointed out that this was it. Forever. Without Lovelace to find a door for her, she had no way out. In all their travels she’d never found her own door. She’d never even seen the doors. She’d always just followed Lovelace, squeezing her eyes shut and hoping it worked. With no guide, she was stuck here.

It served her right, her brain told her. She’d ignored her companion, gotten self-centered. She would spend the rest of her life bettering her “self”, whatever that meant anymore. And how long would that life be? Did she age here? Or was she perpetually middle-aged, existing as long as the internet persisted? What if XX went under, its site expired? Would she just cease to exist, poof?

A restlessness settled in her bones, and the ache drove her up and out of bed. She didn’t bother changing her clothes; she just wandered out into the deep blue night in her T-shirt and sweats.

Good day today. Made some 3rd sector contacts through a Nature Health network. GOod meeting. Not much work done today though. Bah.

R: Where the Crawdads Sing, Dark Archives. W: Take Two. L: bit of Amazon&#39;s &#39;new for you&#39; list.

Heleth walked until she could no longer see the lights of the XX complex, nor the faint glowing bubble of them polluting the sky. Her sweats were studded with burrs and goatheads, but she kept walking into the purple. It felt like a straight line, with the occasional detour around a large mesquite or prickly pear, but she had no idea. Her sense of direction was wonky in the best of times.

Finally, she reached a crossroads. Well, not an actual crossroads so much as a natural one: the desert floor beneath her feat dropped off suddenly into an arroyo, a natural canyon carved by flash floods that could rage through the arid landscape even when not a cloud was in sight. She stood there, far too close to the crumbling edge, a dark ribbon below her and a star-studded blanket above.

She lay down on the sand and gravel, casting a quick glance around for cactus thorns and snakes. The latter was an unlikely danger at night, but with thrice daily warnings about rattlers, she’d learned to look for them everywhere.

Despite the thick layer of rotted cotton she felt surrounded by, sunk into, made out of, the sight of the stars made her feel clean. Here, on a clear night with no moon, no pollution, no humidity, the sky glowed. Not dim speckles of far-off twinkles. Brilliant sparks so sharp and close she felt like she could unplug them if she wanted, in swirls and formations shaping not constellations but galaxies. She felt bathed, as though they were reaching out, painting her with their light, their age, their wisdom.

Well, maybe not wisdom. She didn’t feel any smarter, that was for sure. After all, once she stood up from this astronomy session, she was going to have to find her way back to the XX complex. Distantly, she wondered if she’d left footsteps for herself.

Her head pillowed on coarse, rocky soil, for the first time in weeks she dozed. Her eyes fluttered shut and a quilt of purest black drifted over her, tucking itself around her, tight and comforting and heavy. A warmth settled into her abdomen, its vibrations spreading up and out, down her legs, up her torso, to her head and her fingers and her toes.

Wait. What?

Fairly ordinary day. Started reading through an MA by Research thesis I&#39;m examining next week, and it&#39;s pretty great - all about &quot;alternate reality stories&quot; like Adam McKay&#39;s &quot;Dear David&quot; Twitter story. Very nicely done, and giving me some ideas.

Paul&#39;s dad is back in the hospital, unable to get the edema down. I feel so bad for Paul, but there&#39;s absolutely nothing we can do.

Heleth opened her eyes. The dim gray shapes of the moonless night coalesced around her. She was awake. She was sober. She was alone. And yet she still felt that comforting weight curling into her.

Slowly, she waggled her fingers, bringing them to life. Proprioception resumed, she placed a hand on her stomach.

Not her stomach. Fur.

She crunched up enough to look over her boobs.

“Lovelace!” 

Heleth sat all the way up, scooping the little cat into her arms. She squished the errant furball into her chest, burying her face in the furry belly.

“Where have you been?” Heleth was sobbing, huge wracking sobs of relief. All the tears she couldn’t shed when Lovelace was gone came flooding out, like snow melt off distant mountains carving their way through the desert.

“I went on a sojourn,” Lovelace replied, actively allowing herself to be hugged. “You did self-help, so I did self-help.”

“You told me cats don’t need self-help.”

“We don’t.”

Heleth pulled back enough to examine her cat, leaving tears and snot in the tortoiseshell fur. “You look good. Not quite as fat as before, but not like you’ve been in the desert for weeks and weeks.”

“I haven’t been in the desert for weeks and weeks.”

“So where have you been?”

“Around.”

Human held up feline, staring into her eyes as back paws dangled. “What aren’t you telling me, Lovey?”

“Put me down, please. You know I don’t like being glad-handled.”

This prompted a new sob of joy. Heleth had missed being treated like a peasant so, so much. She plopped the cat back down to her lap, where Lovelace promptly turned and began licking off all the human goo.

“Let me guess,” Lovelace said, “you have no idea how to get back to the complex from here, do you?”

Heleth looked around. “I’m sure I could figure it out.”

“Uh-huh.”

Lovelace turned and trotted back through the desert. She hadn’t gone more than two meters before she disappeared into the shadows.

“Lovey, wait! I can’t see you.”

A darker shadow emerged. “You’ll have to keep up, then. Let’s go.” The cat turned again, and this time Heleth managed to rush after her. “By the way,” Lovelace added, “we’re not going back to the complex.”

“Where the hell else are we going to go?” Heleth almost felt herself huffing out of habit. She was in better shape now, the yoga and hiking and all, even after all the weeks under the big dark, but she felt nostalgic chasing after the cat and that came with being halfway to passing out.

“Through the door.”

“The d—Lovelace!” She hopped over a tumbleweed and hooked the cat under her belly. Lovelace hissed and swatted at her, but Heleth had a safe lock around her rib cage. “Tell me the truth, Lovelace. Where have you been?”

The whiskers twitched, and Lovelace twitched her tail. “Around,” she said.

“What do you mean, ‘around’? You *abandoned* me? I actually wanted to die.”

“We really should seek out a therapy site about that. It’s just a pet.”

“You’re not just a pet. You’re my family.”

“Hmm.” Lovelace got a hind foot into Heleth’s wrist and rabbitted, not quite enough to draw blood but enough to loosen the grip.

“You didn’t go through the door without me.”

“Yes. Of course. Obviously I went through the door without you.” Lovelace resumed her march, expressly showing Heleth her butthole. “I told you I found it, and I was done with this place. So I went.”

Heleth traipsed along in silence for a couple hundred meters. “No,” she said finally. “No you didn’t. You wouldn’t leave without me. For all we know those doors disappear the moment we go through, and you wouldn’t risk us getting separated.”

“Think what you want.” Lovelace marched on.

Heleth continued to push, but the cat wasn’t having any of it. She went silent, and even started trotting. The increased speed made Heleth start to puff for real, and put a pin in her badgering.

An orange glow rose on the horizon, and Heleth breathed a comedic sigh of relief. Or perhaps she just couldn’t find enough oxygen. At least she wouldn’t die in the desert even if Lovelace left her.

The cat stopped, sitting down next to a rather large cholo cactus.

“What?” Heleth asked, waving a hand around. “You live here now? Like some magical questmaster?”

“Don’t be an idiot.”

“Then what are we doing. We can go to bed. Warm, soft, sleepy bed. We don’t even have to get up tomorrow. We can sleep all day. Your favorite.”

Lovelace cleaned her chest.

“This is just a cactus. This is not a nice spot. There’s no tuna juice here, or nice soft pillows. Come on, Lovey. I’m so tired.”

“Of course you’re tired.” The cat’s tongue moved on to that hard-to-reach place on her back. “It’s exhausting to pretend to be a different person.”

“Oh, god.” Heleth rubbed her face with both hands. “Can we not do this now? I feel like roadkill.”

“Fine. Let’s just go, we’ll find a mattress site and have a nap.” The tortie headed into the cactus.

“Wait!” Heleth reached out a hand. “No, I meant go back to the dorm.”

“I know. I don’t care.”

“Lovelace, please!” A sob rose in her throat, and she felt like it might eat her alive. “I’m not done here yet.”

“Done with what?”

Heleth dropped to the ground, ignoring the grind of gravel on her seat bones and wrapping her arms around her knees. That was something she could do now, and she enjoyed the teenaged melodrama of crying into her own patellas.

She turned her head and cried in Lovelace’s general direction. “I’m not done with me, Lovelace. I haven’t achieved everything. I’m not perfect yet.”

“One,” Lovelace began, “how can you achieve anything locked in a cult website. Two, of course you’re not perfect; you’re not a cat. Perfection is thus unattainable, and you should move on.”

“As if I don’t already feel shitty enough, Lovelace, really? I’ve been doing well here, I really have. Look! I exercise now. I can breathe. I get up at the same time every day. I have an idea for a game. I’m working through some of my attachment disorder. You know I have that? I wasn’t sure at first, but Marciana has some therapy credits from when she went to college before her baby and she thinks it’s some form of attachment disorder, and I block everything off so I never really live my life. I’m getting there, you know?”

“And how has all that been going for the last few weeks?”

“I mean, not great.” Heleth wiped her leaky nose on her sweatpants.

“I don’t think you’ve made as much progress as you think. And I’m bored. So can we leave now?”

“I’ve made progress! I have!” A little sob came out. “I’m just so tired.”

Lovelace stood up, padded over, and hopped onto Heleth’s knees. “Here’s the deal,” she said, revving the purr motor to eleven. “This is a one-time-only speech, and if you ever tell anyone about it I will absolutely deny it. Human. Heleth. I love you. *You* you, though. Squishy and awkward and way too into graphic novels and cat art. Are there things you could do to be more healthy and happy? Sure. But that isn’t going to happen here. You’ve just traded one hidey hole for another. And after six weeks of skulking around watching you circle the drain, I am sick to death of this place. So we’re going through that door, and we’re going through it now.”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="170" tags="" position="2250,1125" size="100,100">config.header.right: passage.name

Heleth hiccupped. “You love me?”

“Of course I love you, you human. Do you think I’d hang around if I didn’t?”

The human wrapped the cat into a hug, trapping her entirely against her chest. “I missed you so much, Lovey.” She breathed in the dusty fur, the rumbling purrs, the softness against her face. “Wait. You *hid* from me all this time?”

“I wouldn’t say ‘hid’.”

“You watched how miserable I’ve been? You just sat by while I thought I was going to die from grief?”

“You’ve been very melodramatic. Excellent daytime television.”

“You could have come back after a couple of days, for fuck’s sake!”

“No.”

“No?! Really?”

Lovelace settled down into Heleth’s middle, stretching sideways. “If I came back after a couple of days, you would have been delighted. Punished, but delighted. You would have popped right back into your routine. The hot spring, the seminars, the circles. Eating it up, becoming something you started off only pretending to want.

“That’s why I waited. I waited and I watched. I waited till you were ready to accept that none of this is right for you.”

“I haven’t accepted anything.”

“You have. You’re done with it. You just don’t want to admit it. You don’t want to be the ‘loser’ they would call you for quitting.”

“I’m not quitting,” Heleth insisted.

“You already have.”

Heleth let out a massive sigh and swiped at her tears with her wrists. The night on its surface was quiet, but underneath it was teeming with noise. The rustle of a breeze through mesquite. The chirping of crickets, the chuffing of coyotes. It was a place that got little recognition for its raw beauty; deserts were always portrayed as empty, bereft, lacking. But she could see it was rich, a deep though delicate ecosystem.

She turned back to Lovelace. “I don’t want to go back to who I was,” she whispered.

“Too bad. We are who we are, past present future. Most of what you’ve been doing is confusing yourself.”

“I wanted to be happier!”

“You humans are so focused on happy all the time. If you were happy all the time you wouldn’t even know it. You have to be able to have the unhappy to know what happy is. And if you’re always thinking it’s some kind of goal, you never actually get there.”

“Well. Shit.”

Lovelace stepped once more to the cactus. “Now for the love of all that is holy and warm and tasty in the world, can we fucking go now?”

Sighing, Heleth stood up, brushing grit from her bum. Lovelace gave a happy trill and darted through the invisible opening.

Heleth hesitated, her entire body vacillating. She could stay or she could go. She thought of the yoga classes and the pyramids and the circles and the color charts and the self-help tapes. She thought of warehouses full of sentient objects, trips to her own past—had she really gotten to play on the Holodeck and then *left*, for crying out loud? How dumb was she? And how much longer could she stand here before the door disappeared and Lovelace was gone from her forever?

In the end, that did it. No matter how she’d improved herself, how much fitter she’d gotten, how much more ambitious she was or centered or anything else, she wasn’t happy when she wasn’t with her family. And Lovelace was her family, in toto, be all and end all.

Suddenly, almost in a panic, she dove for the cactus. If the door was gone, she was going to have one hell of a time plucking cholo needles out of her scalp.

Heleth did not wind up with cactus thorns in her head. She hit the doorway and ported through to the interstitial spaces of the internet. She lay there in the cool blue glow of the multitude of screens, much as she had lain in the dark wash of the midnight desert.

“There!” Lovelace announced. “Where do you want to go next?”

“Can you give me a second? I need to adjust.”

“Adjust to what?”

“I just mean… I need to mourn. Who I was becoming.”

Lovelace swatted her on the forehead. “Knock that off. That place was a brainwashing scam.”

“Okay! I get it. I’m just not *there* yet.”

“No! I’m done.” Claws hooked into the fabric of Heleth’s top, dragging at her. “Enough moping and mooning. Get up, let’s go.”

“Unh,” Heleth whined. The claws began to dig into skin. “Ow! Human skin is fragile, Lovelace.”

“Every part of humans is fragile, Heleth. Your psyche most of all.”

“Har har.” Heleth got it together, got up, and wiped her eyes clear. “Fine. Whatever. Let’s do the thing.”

“Great, here we go.” The cat trotted off, a feline on a mission, zeroing in on a particular screen.

“Wait, Lovey, how do we know which site—”

“You don’t get to pick this time. You picked last time, and it turned you all kinds of messed up.” Without waiting, Lovelace sprung up on her hind legs and tapped a screen, darting into the portal.

“I have a bad feeling about this,” Heleth murmured. She put her hand on the screen and portaled through anyway.

They were both getting pretty used to the feeling of being sucked through fiber optics (if that’s what they were traveling through. Surely it was fiber optic cables and not dial up or anything else liable to drop all the packets of their existence).

Mostly good day. Consulted with colleagues on &quot;decolonizing the story&quot; edited collection call, and had to gently tell them to get a BIPOC on board. Had a horrible attempt by RDS to do a crucible-y type thing, but it was the worst. Nice meeting with a woman who runs a charity doing nature-wellbeing projects. Amy gave an awesome research talk to the research group. All around, pretty fair.

Wherever they had landed, it was *loud*. Heleth hadn’t heard such a hubbub since that one high school assembly where Crystal Trejo had found a dead mouse under her chair and set off a domino series of screams that left three girls and one frightened frosh with torn vocal cords.

She looked around. It was like a white dude convention. They’d landed in the a large hall—big, but not Warehouse of Living Objects big—lined with row upon row of exhibitors, somewhere between a state fair and a sales convention. Each three-meter-square space was boxed off into a booth manned (literally manned, in nine of ten booths) by at least three dudebros each.

Heleth looked down at Lovelace, who was curling around her legs, using her as shelter in the storm of thousands of shuffling indoor soccer shoes that had never once seen an indoor soccer surface. “Hoodie?” she asked the little tortie.

“You don’t have a hoodie anymore,” Lovelace pointed out.

Heleth looked down at her yoga-cum-pyjama top. “Oh. Right.” She cast around, spotted a hoodie someone had draped over a booth counter, and swiped it. “Solves that.”

She shrugged into it, wrinkling her nose at the eye-watering volume of body spray and hormones that emanated from it, and poured Lovelace into the hood.

Together in their favored configuration, Heleth and Lovelace strolled through the space. Heleth had never really thought about the different breeds of dudebros that were out there. Here was a box full of sideways-cap-wearing high-fivers in oversized NFL jerseys. There was a circle of tech bros huddled behind gaming laptops covered in boobalicious anime stickers. Around the corner she ran smack into a gaggle of College Republicans, complete with Ken doll haircuts and button-downs hiding their tattoos of the Gipper. Every booth had a sign, but Heleth didn’t need them. Incels, Nazis, fanboys, fuckbois, fratboys, white saviors, shitty boyfriends, performative feminists, #notallmen…

“Hey, there, mama.” A guy with frosted tips sidled up to her. “Can I help you out? You look a little lost. I’d be more than happy to point you in the right direction.”

“Of his penis!” came a shout from the booth behind him, and two dudebros high-fived.

“Ignore them, mamasita,” frosted-tips said to her. “They’re asshoooooles!” He turned on the word “assholes”, so that his pack could understand that they were, indeed, assholes.

“I’m fine, thanks.” Heleth murmured, stepping back.

“Oh yeah she is!” Tweedledum shouted from the booth.

Frosted tips waved them off. “Dudes, right?” he said, as though he were totally on her side, the nice guy, the cute one, only hanging out with them because he was trying to imbue some manners.

He rubbed a palm down Heleth’s upper arm, and she was beyond grateful for the smelly hoodie that protected her from direct skin-to-skin contact. “I got you, fam.”

“Are these guys bothering you, ma’am?”

Oh good. A “ma’am” and a savior. Heleth looked up to find an Oxford dress shirt, a nose full of aftershave, and a $300 haircut that nevertheless failed to stand out as either flattering or particularly stylish. This particular white knight (Heleth added this subgenre to her mental list) wedged himself between her and frosted tips.

“Hey, bro, stay in your lane,” frosted tips protested.

Heleth took the opportunity to fade away into the crowd as the peanut gallery began to meerkat at the thought of fisticuffs. “Holy shit,” she whispered. “This place is a fucking gorilla pit.”

“Mmph,” Lovelace replied.

Heleth hunched her shoulders, hoping the drape of the hoodie would hide her boobs (somewhat diminished thanks to the months of yoga and egg whites at the XX compound), and let her hair form an emo-curtain across her face. Despite this effort, as she skirted the booths she heard dog-whistles and cat-calls (euphemisms that placed rather unfair blame on innocent companion animals), with their standard Doppler shift to “smile, baby”, “you think you’re better than me?”, and finally “lesbo bitch”.

This, a microcosm for the Western world, was not a safe place for a woman, let alone a woman alone.

Suddenly, a vice wrapped around her wrist and she was yanked into a dim space between booths. She opened her mouth to scream, but she caught sight of a rainbow glitter T-shirt just in time. “Oh, thank god,” she said. “You scared the pants off me.”

“Not the first time in my life a woman has thanked her creator for me, believe it or not.” Her kidnapper/actual savior smirked and petted an imaginary bob. “Come on, doll, we gotta get you out of here.” With that, they turned and marched straight into the darkness between booths.

Welp, I got in another gender fight. ELO conference is a sausage fest this year, and Jeneen and I called them out on FB, and we got PUMMELED. Rettberg the worst, as usual. But really gross all around. So we started an open letter, and Dene Grigar called us. Super anxiety, but it turned out she wanted to support us, help us make the letter better, and give us names to sign it. So that was nice. We&#39;ll see. I might be done with the ELO full stop.

He led her to what he called a “floating safe space”. “The testosterone brigade invades any permanent space after a while—like all spaces in the world—so we just keep our fo’s on the move at all times.”

“Okay,” Heleth said, not okay at all.

At the end of a very long, very dark, and occasionally twisty tunnel, they emerged into a very different convention space. No manufactured ten-by-ten booths here—just some folding tables of various sizes and wobbliness. The space was lit primarily by string lights and IKEA lamps.

Despite its rather grungy appearance, the hubbub here was of a completely different quality than the bro convention. The laughter was genuine, and in good supply. There were men, women, gay, straight, bi, trans, young, old, straight-laced, bohemian, tattooed, tall, short, fat, wheelchair-users… just, all the things the crowd outside was not. They wandered to each other’s tables, they chatted, they shared, they occasionally lit up with shouts and hoots and debate, but they all walked away at the end without punches thrown or chests bumped. In a corner or two, quiet spaces pulled away from the rest, smaller groups sat in more earnest conversations, some even with tears or panic attacks.

“I have to go back to my rounds,” her new friend said. “I’m on duty out there for another forty minutes. Just jump in wherever. You’ll be fine here.”

“Wait!” Heleth reached a hand to stop him, but he was already gone, winking at a nearby group of what looked like single moms and swishing his bum back down the corridor.

Before she could “jump in” anywhere, a tiny woman with a flowing mane of wild red hair hooked her elbow.

“New? Come with me.” She dragged Heleth to a table with a couple empty chairs. “What’s your bev pref? Tea, coffee, coconut water, gin?”

Heleth laughed. “That’s an eclectic selection.”

Red shrugged. “So are we.”

Well, today&#39;s episode of the ELO misogyny saga got better. Leo, the President, reached out and assured us he was on our side, that what happened to us was not okay, and they would be working to rectify the situation. We got to have a chat, and it at least helped us feel listened to, which goes a long way toward alleviating my anxiety.

Heleth accepted a tea, and by secret special sense Lovelace detected the presence of milk in its little jug. She trilled and popped out of Heleth’s hood, stretching and making as cute a face as she was capable of in the general direction of the dairy.

“Oh gosh,” Red said. “Where did that come from?”

“Sorry,” Heleth said. “She was napping. This is Lovelace. I’m Heleth.”

“Amaranth, not my real name, obvs.” At Heleth’s raised eyebrow she added, “The relative anonymity of handles helps to keep everyone safe. Whether you’re a douchecanoe who doesn’t want his online trolling to be traced back to you IRL, or you’re a real human being not wanting to get doxxed and SWATted.”

“So that’s where we are,” Heleth muttered to Lovelace. “I think I get it now.” To Amaranth, she said, “You spend a lot of time here, then?”

Amaranth shrugged. “I work a shitty day job with fuck-all to do, so yeah. I pop between here and the knitting forum.” She nodded toward a nearby table completely upholstered in yarn, surrounded by a clutch of clacking knitters.

“Hey, chicas. You new?” A woman plopped into the chair next to Heleth, grabbing a boxed coconut water. She was young, her hair in a pixie cut, a ring in her nose and chunky glasses. Her T-shirt featured an anime character Heleth couldn’t place. When Heleth nodded, she said, “I’m chaotica. Pleasedta.”

She didn’t hold out her hand, so Heleth didn’t hold out hers. “Heleth,” she replied softly.

“You need a handle.”

“Yeah.”

“I like your cat.”

“Of course you do. I’m magnificent. Milk, please.”

Amaranth and chaotica started in surprise, then laughed. “Oh, you two definitely belong here,” Amaranth giggled, worshipping the tortie with long strokes.

“No milk, Lovelace. It does *not* agree with you. Farts that could kill an elephant.”

This set her new friends off into renewed peals of laughter. It was infectious, and soon others drifted to their convo.

Woke up with a nasty PMS headache today, so not a lot of work got done. Had to help Paul have a convo with a potential student from Colombia, which demonstrated to me just how much I suck at speaking Spanish, but I hope I helped. Got to talk to Astrid, which was lovely. I hope she does okay at Bergen in that nest of vipers.

Oh, forgot that Kev emailed us with some CAD drawings of the house the way it used to be, and lots of stories about living here. It was lovely, and I&#39;m going to scan the blueprints we have to send to him.

“Dump him,” Heleth commented three hours later, after discovering it was the answer to anything and everything female-identifying hetero or male-identifying homo. Husband cheating? Dump him. Boyfriend leaves used tissues by the bedside? Dump him. Best friend wants to have sex with you? Dump him. He said that lipstick color isn’t his favorite? Definitely dump him.

The room had thinned somewhat as the American time zones went to bed; Americans always dominated English-speaking domains of the internet, just like the dominated English-speaking everywhere on Earth. The European empires of the nineteenth century had nothing on the entertainment media empire the States colonized the rest of the world with once mass communication took hold.

At least, that’s what once convo thread had discussed. Another was still trickling on, going round and round about the relative pros and cons of different forms of birth control. The general consensus was that it was great, but fuck men for not pulling their weight. A quiet thread in the corner was comforting a woman about concerning results on her most recent pap smear. A still over-excited group was exchanging adrenalin-laced affirmatives after running off a trio of gender crits. Heleth was still struggling to understand the exact nuances of that massive argument; as far as she could tell, some lesbians were afraid that people who weren’t on speaking terms with their own penises would take over the gay agenda and all the women’s toilets. It was not the most cohesive understanding of the argument, she had to admit, and she resolved to have Lovelace explain it to her later.

“What about you?” asked a cishet black man who nonetheless seemed to be a beloved regular in this estrogen (natural or artificial) dominated space. “What kind of animal would you be if you had the choice? Other than human, obvs.”

Heleth looked at Lovelace, sprawled in the middle of the table, basking in adoration. Lovelace caught her glance and said, “Don’t even think it.”

Okay day. More people signing the letter to ELO. Talked to Antje at work, who&#39;s being bullied by Assoc Prof who I&#39;ve had problems with. So. Sick. of. Asshole. Men.

“Um,” Heleth hedged, trying to think of an animal that was not a cat, “I think I’d be… a koala.”

“Oooh, chronic chlamydia. Rough choice.” This from a white woman using a wheelchair and heavy-duty ear protection when the surrounds got noisy.

Heleth shrugged. “Yeah, but I sleep 23 hours a day, I’m always high, and everyone loves me. I’ll take that trade.”

A plump woman with type 4c hair and a grade-A smile laughed. “You’re the Snoop Dogg of the fo’.”

“Prolly more like the Seth Rogen.” Heleth grinned. “Less likely to be best friends with Martha Stewart.”

“Shit,” said one of the nearby knitters, her bright pink undercut a stunning contrast to her brown skin. “Has anyone ever made other women feel more inadequate than Martha Stewart?”

“RuPaul,” said the woman in the wheelchair, whose handle was FarFly. The group cracked up enough that she had to take a few seconds refuge in her earmuffs.

“Don’t you say than name around me.” A starkly pretty man with eyeliner, skinny jeans, and a thick Boricua accent perched on the table, a long tall drink in their hand. “That *comemierda* don’t never pick a Puerto Rican queen to win, even though everybody knows which house is the shit.”

A chorus of groans went up.

“C’mon, Canya,” chaotica said. “This is why we made a separate Drag Race fo’. We can’t handle all drag all day.”

“Oh I know you can’t, mami,” Canya said, their pouty lips pursing to a kiss. “That takes a *real* woman.”

“Trigger warning!” Amaranth cut in. “Dammit, Canya, you know you’ve got to lay off on the buzzwords. That’s how they find us.”

Heleth’s eyes bounced back and forth between the fo’ regulars, failing to keep up with the paranoia as they quieted down.

“What kind of a freaking safe space is it if we can’t use the word ‘woman’?” the curly-haired woman asked. Heleth thought her handle was ButtonMum, which was pretty cute even if her hair wasn’t yellow.

“Of course you can use the word ‘woman’,” boomed a voice. They turned to find a newcomer: can-I-talk-to-the-manager haircut, severe clothes, schoolmarm eyes. “The erasure of women from our society is exactly what some of us are fighting against. You should all be with us.”

A few women on the edges of the crowd nodded, and even Heleth found herself in agreement.

“Fuck me,” Canya said. “Mea culpa, everybody.”

The newcomer introduced herself as SpiritofSBA and stepped to the center of the group. “No group in the history of the world has been as persecuted as the female sex. For millennia we barely even had as much worth as a slave — after all, slaves are at least valued for the work they provide. Women were treated as objects to be traded, or animals to be bred.”

Several people, including chaotica and Amaranth walked away, melting into the edges of the safe space.

“You’re preaching to the choir on this one, Antonia. We know our herstory.” Canya said, waving their hand dismissively at Spirit. 

Heleth mouthed “Antonia?” at Lovelace, who merely poured herself off the table and around Heleth’s ankles.

“Stay in your lane,” SpiritSBA warned Canya. “This is exactly what I’m talking about. Spaces like this are supposed to be safe. To be private. To be our own. We have been kept down for our entire existence, only scratching out a paltry level of recognition for our selves, our selfhood, in the last one hundred years. Women haven’t even had the chance to completely free ourselves of our yokes, to emerge as equals to men, and already we’re having to make room for — wait for it — more *men*. Men like you.”

“Hunty,” Canya said, “you don’t know from men like me.”

Heleth frowned. The woman was kind of right. If women wanted woman-only spaces, and men in whatever form insisted on being part of them, that wasn’t right. It wasn’t *fair*.

The whole world was all about men. Men on the news, men in movies, men were rich and CEOs and stockbrokers. They made the laws, they enforced the laws, they argued the laws, they broke the laws. They got the money, the power, the voice, the toys, the science, the everything. They could do whatever they wanted, and no one ever called them out on it. Some hashtags on social media? What was that when hundreds of thousands of rape kits went untested every year? When husbands and boyfriends were the most dangerous people in their wives and daughters’ lives?

“You think I don’t know men like you?” SpiritSBA turned on Canya. “You think you’re one of us because you insist people call you ‘they’? All you’re doing is forcing your way into where you’re not wanted.”

“What?” Heleth whispered to Lovelace, confused.

“Did you not read the sign on the door, lady?” The new speaker was older, hair in bantu knots, built like a fire hydrant, and androgynous as far as Heleth could tell. “No TERFs, no SERFs.”

“Ah, shit,” Heleth murmured.

Lovelace perked up. “Did someone say ‘surf and turf’?”

“Not the food kind,” Heleth told her. “Jeez, she almost had me.”

“You don’t know who’s in here with you,” SpiritSBA said, pointing at the fireplug, whose handle was kweschan. “I don’t know if that man is really an ally, or just playing like one to insinuate himself here. Even worse, I don’t know your agenda at all.”

“Oh, here we go with the agenda,” kweschan said, throwing up their hands.

“I don’t care if you cut it off and make pretty flowers out of it, you’re still a man. You had all the privileges as men, and now you want what little we have as women? I don’t think so. You’re a woman or you’re a man. I don’t care how you vandalise your body.”

“You do know that trans women, *especially* black trans women, are the most vulnerable people in our society?” kweschan didn’t have to get up in Spirit’s face. They stayed where they stood, quiet, still. “That even in queer spaces, we have been excluded at best, and beaten, and spit on. That we are murdered pretty much without punishment at all.”

“Then make your own spaces,” SpiritSAB said, her tone that of a sullen teenager. “And stop taking ours.”

“We don’t really have to—” Heleth started, but a cacophony of voices drowned her contribution out.

“Where is that supposed to happen? In the magical in-between spaces?”

“—exclusion is not equality—”

“Oh, fuck off!”

More people trickled away, some with faces ducked, others defiant and angry.

SpiritSAB climbed up on a table—wobbly legs and all—and continued her pontificating. “We are not excluding people! We are not discriminating against anyone. Everyone has a right to exist, to have their own spaces. We have a right to ours! We are women. We are born women. We are biologically women, and our experiences are unique to biological women. We are simply insisting that we hold on to the rights we have worked for so long, and so hard to achieve. We are not going to dilute it by promoting biological men at women’s expense. It simply isn’t fair! You get to have all the advantages of being male, and then you have to come for women’s spaces too? Do any of you feel the dilution of your concerns in this group? What about you? Would you enter into a relationship with a man who calls himself a woman? What if he tricked you?”

“You’re making problems where there en’t any, mujer,” Canya called. “Nobody’s trying to trick nobody.”

“I’m done with this bullshit,” kweschan said, waving their hand dismissively. They walked off into the darkness.

ELO went pear-shaped again today as Jill sent escalating messages and we sent to the board, who engaged in way more himpathy than I can accept, so I&#39;ve withdrawn from ELO. Feel better about that, frankly. Did some farm work today, hanging gates and doing more rat-proofing in the coop.

SpiritSAB took no notice. She merely continued her ranting, railing about how the transgender “agenda” was harming children, confusing them about what gender really was, and who they were, and who they should be, leading to adults full of regret and mutilated bodies. 

If asked, Heleth could not have said why she stayed. She didn’t yell at the woman, didn’t snort or laugh or sling insults. She felt the urge to follow the rest into the darkness, to abandon this once-friendly place and find another. She very much wanted to avoid this woman, her diatribes, her fear, her hatred. Yet she stayed. She listened to the arguments, the counterarguments, the claims on science and logic from both sides. All sides.

Eventually, the only ones left were those who agreed with SpiritSAB, or who didn’t care enough either way—a pathetic sentiment that gained no one’s respect. And Heleth and Lovelace.

Without anyone arguing against her, SpiritSAB quieted, climbing down off the table. She started to head off toward some other dark hole where she could spread her insidious message, but Heleth called out and drew her back.

“Yes?” 

“Why?” Heleth asked, softly and without aggression.

“Why?” Spirit repeated.

“Why do you do this? Your speech cleared the room, but not before you received insults and anger and even hatred. If they could have, some of them might have hit you. So, why do it?”

“Ah.” Spirit smirked. Not a smile: a smirk. “Because the cause of feminism is a war. And every person who wakes up to the reality that the slim bit of ground we’ve gained over the last hundred years is crumbling under the weight of yet more men, that’s one more to fight the good fight.”

Heleth sat on the edge of the table, and Lovelace curled into her lap.

“I’m just curious,” Heleth began, “what is your endgame?”

“Endgame?”

“You know, your ideal world. Say tomorrow you wake up and everyone listens to you, and makes all the changes you want, and you can create the world just as you envision. What would that be?”

“A world in which men and women are equal in all ways.”

Heleth nodded, while Lovelace’s whiskers twitched. “That’s a really simple way of saying something really complicated.”

“No, it’s not. There are men in the world, and there are women. If we have the same opportunities, the same pay, the same power, and an equal share in positions of influence, we have achieved equality.”

Twitch, twitch, twitch went Lovelace’s tail, and Heleth stroked a hand down her back. “So what is a man?”

SpiritSBA rolled her eyes. “This is ridiculous.”

One of the remaining hangers-on spoke up. “A man is someone born with a penis.”

“Fair enough,” Heleth nodded. “So we define ourselves by absence or presence of male genitals.”

“No, that’s not right,” SpiritSBA said. “It’s not the penis, but it is biology. DNA. Chromosomes. Women are double-X and men are XY, and we all develop accordingly. Men, women, sexual reproduction, more men and women.”

“Of course there are exceptions,” Heleth said. “No process is without duplication mistakes, and developmental diversions. Xes don’t split, biology doesn’t differentiate, hormones don’t balance. There are a lot of things that can vary when you start to make the human cake.”

“Abnormalities. Deformations,” Spirit said with certainty. “Diseases that should be treated medically.”

“Many are treated medically. Hormone supplementation and gender reassignment are medical treatments.”

“They’re mutilations.” Spirit’s jaw clenched. “A result of a culture crumbling into deviations, kids brainwashed into thinking they can and should change who they are. We have an obligation to treat their mental illness appropriately, not to just let them surgically alter themselves whenever the whim strikes them.”

Busier Monday than I&#39;ve come to be used to. Attended a talk from Sara Ahmed (feminist killjoy), and it was wonderful. Letter came out from ELO promising some good and positive actions, if they actually do them, so we&#39;ll sit and watch if that happens. Spent a long time this evening talking to a new colleague who is struggling to get along in her new job. Watching a docu about some crazy Mormons who bomb each other over old letters saying that Joseph Smith got messages not from an angel, but from a salamander. So that happened.

The hangers-on seemed to be growing, arms crossed, nodding their heads at this. All women, some men. Mostly white, seeming to be middle class, with their Hilfiger looks and sitcom-ordinary haircuts. Heleth shifted uneasily, caught between her discomfort amongst such strident and exclusionary believers and an awareness that from the outside, she looked like she belonged among them.

“Where do genetic and physiological divergences fall?” she asked softly, eyeing the crowd, searching for signs of belligerence. “Hermaphroditism, intersex conditions, XXY?”

“Anomolies,” SpiritSBA said, clearly used to this line of reasoning. “They should ideally be diagnosed in the womb and treated.”

“Treated?” Heleth repeated. She saw a nearby man’s brow furrow.

“Clearly these are malformations. If they cannot be corrected in the fetus,” SpiritSBA said, holding firm to her clinical terms and passive voice, “then the healthiest approach is to terminate and allow for the normal fertilization of a new life.”

A few in the surrounds shuffled, murmuring a bit. “Termination” easily translated into “abortion”, and enough of them thought their control over people’s genitals and bathrooms should also extend to their uteruses. Heleth felt some relief at their fragmentation. 

“But aren’t there conditions doctors can’t find that early?” Heleth pushed again. “Things that develop later, hormone imbalances that cause issues, things like that?”

“Treatable with appropriate medical care,” Spirit insisted.

“I apologize if it seems like I’m a bit thick,” Heleth said, utterly disingenuous. “My cat would tell you I’m the dumbest creature she’s ever met.” A few in the crowd tittered; cats always won hearts on the internet.

“It’s important that people learn to be gender critical,” SpiritSBA offered magnanimously.

“Of course,” Heleth agreed externally. “So babies are born, they’re assigned their gender—”

“Not assigned. They are what they are biologically.”

“Oh yes, genitals. My bad. So babies are born, they have one set of genitals or another, and they grow up. What’s on their birth certificate is what they are, no matter what, no matter how they feel? Even if it causes extreme distress, and even self-harm?”

Long day, lots of it on zoom. Tired.

SpiritSBA smiled, a pat on the head sort of smirk. “Mental illness has many causes, and there are many courses of treatment. But it comes down to biology. If you place your trust in science, then you know it is DNA, physiology—your rare hermaphrodite examples aside. To say that someone is a ‘woman in a man’s body’ is to assume what? Not just a soul, but a *gendered* soul. One that can feel the difference between its gender and its body’s gender. That’s what you have to believe if you think transgenderism is a legitimate thing that requires permanent disfigurement and lifelong medication.”

This soliloquy earned the woman more nods, agreement. Heleth thought, long and hard, struggling to come up with another perspective. This was why these opinions were so insidious. They played on fear: women’s fear of men. Men’s fear of homosexuality. Everyone’s fear of those who are different. So many stories and religions framed queerness and trans people as deviant, sinful, wrong. Buffalo Bill, urging kidnapped women to lotion up so that his woman-suit would be soft and supple. Media lumped pedophiles with cross-dressers, trans women with rapists, intersex with incest and inbreeding. Thousands of years of hiding led to stories of monsters: parents hiding atypical children, people repressing their queerness, their dysmorphia, their desires and their natures. Indigenous cultures all over the globe recognized third genders, and sometimes even more, but the strict adherence to binary gender and heterosexuality in Western, monotheistic society washed those recognitions away into obscurity.

Of course, Heleth didn’t really know all this. Lovelace did, but she didn’t care. The inanity of human squabbling bored her. It was far more interesting when their arbitrary beliefs in mythological beings and rules led to mass slaughter and chaos, but even then she acknowledged it was more troublesome than entertaining: humans at war often forgot to idolize their feline companions.

The cat rose from her reclined position against Heleth’s thigh, arching her back and yawning a terrible lion yawn. She sat, curling her tail into a base, and eyed the collected parties.

“Enough,” she said, her voice rebounding through the space though her mouth never moved. As usual. “Enough of this absolute nonsense. You call yourself the spirit of Susan B. Anthony. You have no idea just how right you are in that comparison: the mother of your suffragette movement was also a raging bigot. She wanted the vote for women, but only white women. She railed against equal rights for black men, believing them beneath her; it’s doubtful the idea of lobbying for black women’s rights ever crossed her mind.

“Your notions of sex and gender are superficial. You assume a hierarchical purpose to biology, with all the complexity of thought one might expect from an Edwardian pre-adolescent. Richard Dawkins might argue about selfish genes, but he is a known dick, even to cats, whom one would think had already cornered that market, but no. Like all social animals, the propagation and survival of the human species is in no way solely dependent upon sexual reproduction. That is merely step one. Your babies are born useless, and remain useless and vulnerable for years; your mothers require help to nurture and feed and protect their offspring. Your tribes require memory-keepers, teachers, builders, hunters, gatherers, meal-preparers, babysitters, wet nurses, healers, organizers, warriors, and yes, even idiots like you, keeping the rest on their toes, to persist in your ecological niche. A family needs only a fecund few to replenish itself from generation to generation; the remaining roles can be filled by any range of genders, sexualities, races, and abilities.

“Were you aware that many animal species engage in what your culture has long held as ‘deviant’ sexual behavior? Homosexuality, polyandry, even masturbation are all common in a wide array of mammals. There are gay penguins, gender-fluid sharks, intersex kangaroos, and countless species that can reverse their sex in given situations and environments. *That* is biology: endless variation and continua of change.

“Your bullshit about souls is already mixing metaphors. Forget chromosomes and genitalia and hormones, all of which contribute to the complexity of gender and sexuality. People are *weird*. Your useless young remain undeveloped and plastic for decades. Any number of factors and environments and experiences and beliefs can lead a person to think and feel an infinite number of ways about how they fit into their tribe. And now that your human tribe is connected all over the world, and your youth are exposed to more and more cultures and people who might feel similar to how they do, they are more able to come to terms with how comfortable they are in their bodies, in their minds, in their clothes, in their actions, with their haircuts, with their names, with how others see them, how they see themselves.

“You, you dire descendent of a litany of selfish bigots, you are not even worth the mental energy it has taken me to school you on the actual state of your own species. Your diatribes against the most vulnerable in your society—those who are beaten, killed, by strangers, by their own families, and most horrifically, by themselves—not only harm them, they harm the very women you claim to be protecting. Where will your exclusionary policies lead? To genital examinations prior to entry in every public restroom and locker room? More policing of bodies, segregation, labelling? More violence, more bullying, more suicides. That’s where your narcissistic fear leads, you breathtakingly short-sighted and hateful sack of ignorance.”

Finally done, Lovelace jumped down from the table and marched into the dark corridor leading away from the once-secret locale, her tail raised in a self-satisfied smirk.

Heleth blinked, looking around at the stunned faces. She felt a slow grin slide across her face, and she raised her hands into a slow clap. She kept it up as she stood and followed Lovelace.

They made their way out to the main hall. Back to the dudebros and the frats and the fanboys. Lovelace climbed straight up Heleth and back into her hood.

“Lovelace, no fair hiding out,” Heleth whispered back to the cat. “You’ve got to find us a door.”

“Somewhere in this cavern is a troop of men who burned cats as boys.”

“Oh, no doubt there are multiple groups of dickwads like that,” Heleth said. “Which is why we need a gorram door.”

“Let’s just go where the other nice people went.”

“I don’t know where that is. They kept it a secret, remember?”

“Add human reliance upon linguistic communication to the list of species-based inferiorities,” Lovelace said, jabbing a particularly sharp needle claw into Heleth’s shoulder. “Were it cats, we could sniff our way into the hidden lair.”

Heleth reached back and de-stabbed the tortie’s claw from her skin. “Yes, you are very right, Lovey. Cats are superior in every way. Now, door?”

“Don’t see one,” the cat pouted.

“Then we need a place to huddle up till you do.”

Heleth wandered, keeping her gaze from connecting with the various chest-beaters and mansplainers, trying to find a place where there might be more of a mix. Surely amongst all these gear-heads and war-gamers was an LGBTQIA+ group, or a bunch of geeks or something.

She speculated as to what that could be. A Harry Potter group would be pretty geeky and mixed, but it would probably be prone to bullying; it might have gone the way of the women’s forums and found a secret niche. IT groups were dominated by code-bros. Soccer groups might be okay, depending on the dominant nationality (it would be just like her to walk into a horde of English hooligans). She’d just started to eyeball a travel board when she spotted it. The mecca of utopia—well, Heleth’s mecca anyway.

The Star Trek board. True, it was still dominated by men, and it had an uncomfortable tendency toward awkward exchanges, but it was also a space dominated by the philosophies of equality, acceptance, tolerance, and peace.

Heleth slipped in with a Vulcan salute, and instantly felt that at least she was amongst humans again. Humans who were flawed and nerdy, sure, and more than one dressed up to be and use a language decidedly alien in origin, but humans all the same.

She sat quietly for a few minutes, but it only took one reference to Next Gen before she couldn’t resist informing the group that she’d been on a Holodeck.

It stopped the convos dead, and Heleth soon found herself at the center of attention.

“How’s that even possible?” DeannasTherapyPlant asked. “Last time I checked, we don’t have holo-tech.”

“VR,” a teen with Trill make-up said, bored. “There’s TNG repros on VR.”

“No, I was really there. I stumbled onto Netflix, and hopped on the *Enterprise*.”

“Sorry, what?” NebulaCoffee said. Her hair was in a Janeway coiffure, and she had a little Chakotay tattoo drawn down one side of her face. Nice ’ship. “You know it’s a TV show, right?”

Heleth rolled her eyes. “Obvs,” she said. “But look, we’re in the internet, right? This isn’t what discussion boards look like in the real world. So just like we’re here in person chatting, instead of posting text messages to one another, when you get transported into a streaming TV show, it’s like you’re there. In that world.”

Looks were exchanged. HesDeadJim, a scrawny boy with a deep Louisiana accent, placed a hand on Heleth’s arm.

“You okay?” he asked. “Where is it you think you are?”

She met his concerned gaze straight on. “The Internet. This is Reddit. Or Craigslist. One of them, anyway.”

A woman in a fluffy Deanna Troi wig, her pale skin sparkling with glitter moisturizer, sat Heleth down. “You think you’re inside the Internet?”

“Yes,” Heleth said. “Obviously.”

HesDeadJim stood in front of her, and she counted the dark freckles marching across his brown cheeks. “Well, that’s a tale, ain’t it? How’d you get into the Internet?”

“It was an accident. Lovelace—” Heleth paused, reached awkwardly behind her head, and dragged the tortie out of her hood. She held the sleepy cat up. “Lovelace and I got sucked in. We’ve been wandering around for ages, trying to find a way out.”

“We haven’t always been trying to find a way out,” Lovelace commented. She explained, “My human is rather distractable.”

“So she ain’t just crazy,” HesDeadJim said to the cat. “Y’all really believe you’re in the Internet?”

“Wait,” Heleth threw in. “You think I’m nuts for saying I’m on the Internet and I’ve been to the Holodeck, but a telepathic talking cat is cool with you?”

Glitter Deanna—RickBermanIsADick by handle—shrugged. “All cats talk. Not all cats claim to have been to the *Enterprise*.”

“Lemme ask,” Heleth said, trying to right her swaying conception of time and place, “if we’re not in the Internet, where are we?”

“We’re at Craigslist,” HesDeadJim told her.

“Yeah, that’s what I said. Reddit or Craigslist.” Heleth looked around. “I guess Reddit would be even bigger and more dangerous.”

“Stay away from the ad spaces here,” RickB said, “and you tend to be fairly safe. Surrounded by dickheads, but safe, anyway.”

Heleth tucked Lovelace against her torso. “But this is a website. Craigslist is a website.”

This earned her a few laughs. “What kind of website would this even be?” The nonbinary Trill was back, and this time Heleth caught their handle: AlexiaDax. “How do you make a website that’s just people talking?”

“How do you make a website that’s *not* people talking?” Heleth asked. At the multitude of blank faces, she pinched the bridge of her nose. “Okay, let me try this a different way. What do you all do when you’re not here?”

“I go next door to my fanfic group,” AlexiaDax said.

“Yeah, or down where all the photos are. They change all the time. Just people, but art, you know?” an older Klingon added.

“I have to work a lot,” RickB said, “so I’m there, you know, chatting with my coworkers, taking them files and things. I go to the movies, I go shopping. You know, life. Internet.”

Heleth scritched Lovelace and hitched her up a little higher. “Where do you sleep and eat?”

“At home, like ever’body else,” HesDeadJim said. “Are you doing the alien thing? Because these are real alien questions.”

“What about computers? What do you do with computers?” Heleth asked, desperate to find something, anything that would make sense.

“Huh?” HesDeadJim asked.

“You mean like adding and multiplying and stuff?” AlexiaDax said, their Trill-painted brow furrowing. “My ancient math teacher sometimes calls calculators computers.”

“They have no idea,” Lovelace told Heleth. “This is not a conversation you are going to win.”

“Conversation is not a competition,” Heleth snapped back. “But yeah, I see your point.”

Abruptly, as one does in a forum, Heleth got up and left. No one stopped her or tried to call after her.

She faded into the background as much as she could, lurking in a meme competition forum.

“Lovey, you have got to find us a door.”

“Remember how long it took us at the last place,” Lovelace said. “I wouldn’t get your hopes up.” Yet she dropped to the floor and proceeded to seek an exit.

“Please don’t let this take six months,” Heleth whispered.

“Oh,” Lovelace said. “Nevermind. That was easy. Come on.” She ducked under a table and disappeared. Beyond grateful, Heleth followed.

In the now-familiar between space, Heleth slumped to the floor. She groaned, and it quickly rose to a somewhat garbled scream of frustration.

“Is this what it feels like to be on a hamster wheel? What are we even doing, Lovelace?”

The cat sprawled on her side. Her mouth gaped wide, but unlike Heleth, all she did was yawn and clean between her toes. “You said the same thing three trips ago.”

“And I’m sure I’ll say it again three trips from now. What even is this? If it’s a coma, I really wish they’d unplug me already.” Heleth took a deep breath and hollered into the darkness: “Hello, out there? Yes? Unplug me!”

Of course, nothing happened, because Heleth was not in a coma, and no one was listening.

“Would you like to select a new site for perusal?”

“Why?” Heleth whined. “What’s even the point? And is there even anything left other than porn?”

“Some,” Lovelace commented. “There’s still most of the endless recipe blogosphere, most commercial sites, everything that’s not in English, and we haven’t even touched on the worst of the regular web, much less the dark web.”

Heleth snapped her head around. “The dark web?”

“Yes. The dark web. Where everyone is anonymous and murdery. Really, they should call it the cat web. It’s a better metaphor.”

“I know what the dark web is, smart aleck. But I haven’t seen any of it in these screenportals.”

Lovelace sneezed. “You know what it looks like on TV when they mock-up hired assassin sites and snuff streams on *Criminal Minds*.”

“No,” Heleth said, scowling. “I’ve been on the dark web.”

“I call shenanigans.”

“Whatever.” Heleth sat for a few moments, pretending she wasn’t thinking what she was thinking. “Whatever,” she said again, this time with a determined intonation. “Let’s go there.”

Lovelace rolled on her back, writhing in cat laughter. “Really truly? You nearly just got your ass handed to you by some Reddit nerds, and now you want to go to the *dark web*?”

“Craigslist nerds,” Heleth muttered. “Come on, what’s the worst that can happen?”

“We die.” The tortie remained on her back, stretching her back limbs. It was *not* a dignified position. “Except first we are tortured. You will likely have unspeakable things visited upon you. I will only avoid the exact same things because I am of the feline persuasion, but nonetheless will likely experience some equally horrific things. Heleth, my clumsy goliath friend, the dark web is not the goth version of the Internet as you might imagine it to be, painted in Halloween palettes and rocking with that underworld Norwegian metal vibe. The dark web is *dark*. It is *the* underworld. It is arms deals and human trafficking. It is where vile men swap stories of the daughters they have kept for decades in dank basements. Where photos that no human should ever see are bought and sold like postcards. Lives are bought and sold there, and not with the cultural trappings of capitalism and politics to put a rosy shine on the dealings. It would be better to swim naked and open-mouthed through sewage.”

“All right, all right, I get it. Enough.” Heleth sighed. Gravity felt somehow stronger, and she could feel it dragging at her limbs, her skin, her boobs, her head, even her hair. She didn’t know what she looked like at this point, but she felt 87 years old and haggard. Ridden hard and put away wet. Like a thousand miles of bad road. And other clichés for old and beat.

“You’ve talked me out of it,” she told Lovelace, “for now. So what the hell do we do, oh wise and snarky one? Because I have no desire left for anything or anyone right now.”

“I’m not the decider. That’s your remit,” Lovelace said. “I have no druthers, other than not getting set on fire.”

“If this were a game, I would go find a cheat code or a walkthrough or something.”

“If this were a game, you’d have already died a dozen times.”

“Fair,” Heleth agreed. “It’s a thought though. A game. I guess it’d be a sandbox, because if it’s an RPG it’s got really crappy guidance, and no missions at all. But the problem with thinking of it as a sandbox is that there’s no point to it other than what we make it. What are we even making of it? And if it’s *not* a sandbox, and there’s some kind of endgame, what the heck is it? To go home? To get out? To find a Shangri-la on the web, a happily ever after? Heck, I think at this point I’d be ecstatic to find out we’re trying to save a princess.”

“Maybe it’s both, and you have to make it up.”

“Oh, god.” Heleth rubbed her face, hard. “I’m doing a bang-up job of it so far.”

Lovelace got to her feet, rearranged herself, and tucked her body into a tight little furball. “You’ve purposefully avoided making any decisions whatsoever. As per usual. Perhaps you could give that a go.” With that, she yawned, snuggled her head under her own legs, and slept.

Heleth eyed the tortie enviously, but also with an urge to bury her nose in the fur and suck in as deep a breath as possible. She resisted, weighing the temptation against the very high possibility of getting a pawful of razors raked across her face. In the end, she contented herself with curling her own body around her cat in a C-shape, pillowing her head on her arm and resting one hand on the gently snoring kitty.

Feeling awful today. Still got some stuff done, but feel horrid. Stupid uterus.

Despite their donut (croissant?) formation, Heleth could not find sleep. Instead, her mind raced. It was like that Wikipedia game they used to play when she still had to go into an office every day to do her job: pick a topic, hit “random page” and see who can work their way through the internal links to the topic the fastest. Kinda like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon before IMDB made it all too easy. Her mind shuffled through random scenarios, and she travelled down the pathways, leaping on to new ones through tenuous links.

She started with Lovelace’s challenge: what was it she wanted? Where did she actually want to go? They’d been surfing so far, hopping through screenportals on whims and impulsion. Oh, sure, in the beginning she’d had some thought about getting home, back to the real world, back to her ordinary life. But it had been months since she thought about that. It felt like years. What color was her sofa? Did she have any house plants? She couldn’t remember. She’d lost track of her own phone number, and her postal address rearranged itself every time she tried to think of the sequence.

She’d also once thought about happy ever after. Who she would be if she could be. She’d briefly thought about replaying her marriage. Briefly. She’d thought she could find herself in the desert.  In hindsight, of course, Lovelace had been right about XX. It wasn’t the end-all and be-all she’d thought it was when she was in the middle of it. The yoga and the seminars and the levels and all the sharing and actualizing—it hadn’t enlightened her. It had buried her.

Buried. Her mind jumped to her mother’s graveside. She was thirteen years old, and her mom was gone. She didn’t know how to feel sad about that.

She knew she should feel sad. The movies and TV shows and books and all her teachers telling her it was okay to be sad told her that she should be sad. But she wasn’t. What she felt was a lightening. A release. Like she’d been holding her breath for thirteen years, and finally she’d been able to let all that used up carbon dioxide free. She’d attended spotty therapy sessions in her twenties, because that was also something you were supposed to do, and all her therapists had wanted her to explore this “dynamic presentation of alternative emotions”. One outdated old psychologist had theorized it was a perfectly acceptable reaction to an Electra complex to be triumphant that her competition for her father’s love was no more. Another had subtly felt her out for sociopathic tendencies (which Heleth later sussed out by googling the questions the shrink had asked). Most just thought she was covering for a deep and abiding grief, that she had never truly faced her mother’s death, and therefore it would continue to arrest her development as a human being until she did so.

She did not.

She had loved her mother. She never thought there was any other way to feel toward her mother. But also there were other feelings. Worry. Frustration. Exhaustion. Most of all, fear. Her mother hadn’t been abusive, not in the ways they tell you about at school. She didn’t hit Heleth, or lock her in closets, or deny food or water. She had, nonetheless, left a lot of scars. There were the low days, when Heleth would be left at school, no one to pick her up, no message, no note, just no one. When she would finally make her way home (often in ways that, as an adult, she was constantly astounded hadn’t resulted in kidnapping, assault, or death), her mother would be there, but not there. In the dark, awake, but not responsive.

There were up days too. Days when she would take Heleth shopping, which had never been her favorite activity. Heleth had never really grown out of her baby fat, nor into her shape. She was a bit… blobby, if you asked her. She’d come to accept it as an adult—an adult who didn’t put much effort into attracting potential mates—but as a kid she’d declared war on her own body. Yo-yo diets, low-fat, low-carb, cleanses, detoxes, any fad that came along. None of it worked, of course, and the long-term effects warped her metabolism, cementing her amoeba-like body shape in stone. So shopping, with its endless cycles of gathering potential outfits, decamping to a cramped changing room—her mother sitting in the corner, passing judgment on every item—having to see, up close and personal and under harsh fluorescents, just how non-*Teen Vogue* her body truly was, was devastating. Every. Single. Time. Swimsuit shopping usually ended in fits of enraged tears.

But her mother took delight in it. She wouldn’t let Heleth put any item in the “no” pile. She would purchase everything Heleth tried on, whether Heleth liked it or not, and pack it into Heleth’s closet and dresser as though Heleth would miraculously change her mind and embrace every piece with joy and love in her heart. When she was older, she would quietly pack the clothing back up, slyly nick her mother’s credit card and the receipts, and take everything back, letting the store zero out the debt her mom had racked up. As a kid, the best she’d been able to do was stuff them in her backpack, a little at a time, and shove them in the donation bin on her way to the bus stop.

Her mother never hurt her. She always had food, a roof over her head. But she was never certain that her mother loved her for *her*. She felt like a toy, a doll to be dressed up and played with on good days, cast aside and forgotten on others. She learned not to count on her mother, even as she had to take care of her and clean up after her wilder binges.

The day her mother died, Heleth had waited at school. It had been a rocky month, and she was resigned to once again make her way home on busses and bike trails (age had taught her the wisdom of public transportation rather than relying on the goodness of teachers or classmates’ parents). It was close to dinnertime when she finally made it home, the apartment dark and still. She’d gone to the kitchen to see if there was anything left worth eating, feeling lucky to find a box of cereal and some shelf milk, then gone to throw her backpack in her room.

She’d been the one to find her. The doctors later called it an adverse reaction to mixing prescription medication, but she’d never believed them. Not really. She had called emergency services and waited for them to arrive. When they did, she had let them do what they did, and fail, and then she’d faced the problem of who to be without a parent.

She’d gone to live with her uncle, a man she had never met and who hadn’t even known she existed. Her mother’s falling out with her family had been so dramatic, so firm, that none of them had been in contact with her for over fifteen years.

Odd, it was the first time she’d thought of her uncle since this whole cyberadventure had started. She hoped time passed differently here than it did back in the actual world, and she really hadn’t disappeared for months and months. Or worse, that she was in a coma, or unconscious, or dying, with him weeping over her. Because he was a weeper. She’d once gotten him a Garfield card for Father’s Day, and she’d thought he was going to have an asthma attack. She’d just stood there, struck silent, wondering if she’d broken him.

What would Uncle Kelly say if she could talk to him now? she wondered. Then she sighed. He would want to go visit all the gayest rainbow sites on the web, and never leave.

She imagined it. Could the web hold utopias for everyone, separate, but equal? It was like her childish notion of heaven, that everyone had a different heaven, just suited to them (in a blatant infinite abundance of resources, of course). She didn’t want to go to a Baptist’s heaven, and she was pretty sure they wouldn’t want to go to hers. Maybe the Internet was it (she shied away from the notion that maybe this really wasn’t the Internet, that she had electrocuted and concussed herself when her coffee spilled into her laptop, that she was dead and this was the afterlife; it was far too *Lost* a plotline to be feasible). Maybe the web could provide safe spaces where even the strangest birds could find their flock.

Furries had done it. That had to be evidence of something.

She knew where her uncle would choose to go. Somewhere pansexual, yet completely dedicated to those type of women’s films designed solely to make you cry. He was a weeper, and somehow still sought those stupid movies out. *Steel Magnolias*. *Beaches*. *Terms of Endearment*. Perhaps she’d never formed many relationships with women because she’d thought that to do so meant that one of you would get cancer, and the other one would be left grieving. Or, you know, her mom-baggage was still weighing her down.

Anyway, Uncle Kelly might have a utopia hidden here somewhere. So that left Heleth with the question of what her utopia would be, in the theoretical spaces of the Internet’s in-between. She lay next to Lovelace and mentally scrolled through her options.

One. A game. Somewhere inside an online game, where there were really no consequences, and the landscape allowed for infinite variety. Second Life, maybe. Oh, it had been lightning hot in the early aughts, and a lot of folk now thought it was dead and gone, but it definitely wasn’t. It had stabilized and continued to evolve like any other community. She could go there, build a little island for herself and live forever after. It would have to be a sandbox; a first-person shooter was obvs out of the picture, and any other mission-oriented game would definitely get repetitive after a while. She didn’t want to wind up trapped in a toilet or a swimming pool in The Sims, and she already felt her shape was blocky enough, let alone Minecraft blocky, but maybe there was something.

Two. A film. Just about everything was streaming now, and she could find one she liked and settle in. Grow hairy feet and live in The Shire. Go back to the *Enterprise* and enlist as a lower decks technician, mostly unnoticed, yet with access to the most wonderful technical utopia that had ever been envisioned. Or maybe an anime, with magic powers and mythical forces.

Three. She supposed as long as she was thinking about film and TV, she could think about books. Maybe she’d be smartest to go into a book, where there were more details and richer storyworlds, yet her imagination could shape the landscape. She’d have a lot of fun in Discworld, she felt. Oz was always an option—she’d have to avoid China Town because she was far too clumsy for those porcelain creatures, but otherwise it could be interesting. If she browsed long enough, she was sure she could find a book or series that would be an amazing place to serve out her time. Life-wise, that was.

Four. A realism trip. She could go into a memory, somewhere she was happy, somewhere she could always be happy. Assuming it had been documented somehow, somewhere. Obviously not her honeymoon in Mexico. That hadn’t been nearly happy enough to live in forever, and it came with the added detraction of her ex always being there. Nope, no way. Her mind sifted through various memories, but her moments of happiness were all fleeting, and none centered in any particular locale.

Five. Somewhere new. It would take more wandering, but at least this time it would be directed wandering. She could pick and choose based on a set of criteria: good food, safe for cats, not too much sun.

Alternatively, six. Initially the same thing, but choosing places based on the ones most likely to lead to a door out. Out of the Internet, back home to the real world.

Which led to seven. No goal at all, just continue wandering. Purposeless.

Seven options. It was still too many. Mentally, she clumped the first three into one: jump into a mythical universe made real by the magic of the Internet. And if she really thought about it, five and six were the same as seven, until she actually found one or the other. Three options. Magic, memory, or meander. Where was a die when you needed one?

Eyes closed to the blue light of the screenportals around her, she turned round and round, mentally facing each of her three options. Magic. Memory. Meander. She liked that she’d found three M words to describe them. It made them feel equal, even. Magic. Memory. Meander. Magic. Memory. Meand…

The deep blue faded to black. She slept.

She woke. Her first thought was pain, an unmitigated ache that felt like her blood was pooling, throbbing and hot, in her joints. The hip against the floor, that same shoulder and elbow and ankle. Her spine felt as though it had been wrung dry of all synovial and cerebrospinal fluid. With a groan, she rolled to ease the agony.

Her arm was wet, saliva leaking from the corner of her mouth in a steady flow. Her eyes felt sandy, dry, the inside of her eyelids scraping redly across her eyeballs as she forced them open. 

Turning over only turtled her, and she seemed to be wedged between something hard and something less hard. Opening her eyes was taking some time, as they neither wanted to focus nor stay open. She flopped for a few moments, panicking, until she finally managed to sit upright.

Breathing heavily, she blinked until her eyes stopped screeching. She still couldn’t see anything. Waited. Gradually, dim shapes formed in grays and blacks and darker grays and blacks. Yet not scary. Familiar.

She reached out a hand, feeling around in the dark. In front of her, a table. Behind, a sofa, soft and worn. And, her mind told her, covered in tortoiseshell cat hair.

“Lovelace!” Heleth gasped. “I think we’re home.”

She used the table and the sofa to stand up, her eyes adjusting even further. She could see the mess of her laptop and coffee mug in the shadows, the stain of the coffee a black blob on the rug. She shuffled to the lamp and reached under its skirt, turning the switch. Nothing but a click. Frowning, she felt her way to the wall and flipped the overhead light on. Darkness prevailed.

Right. Coffee plus laptop seemed to have knocked out more than just Heleth. She turned that over a few times, tasting it. It was wrong, like too much garlic was both impossible and wrong. Between surge protectors and casings and fuses, it seemed pretty unlikely that coffee in a laptop could deliver a charge that would knock both her and her electricity out.

She shook it off. She could figure it out later. “Lovelace?” she called. “Where are you?”

She felt around for the cat, fumbling. “Lovey, come on. You have to be here.” But the cat didn’t answer her. “Dammit, I can’t see a freaking thing.”

The electricity was out, even if it was just a fuse. She had no idea if she had a flashlight anywhere. She had no need for a flashlight. She did have some candles, but the matches were in the kitchen. It had been so long since she had carried a cell phone that she didn’t immediately consider it. When it finally occurred to her, she thwacked herself on the forehead and then said, “Okay, Google!” About two meters away, a light appeared at about thigh height, and Google chimed and asked how it could help her.

She told it to turn on her flashlight, and lo, there was light. She grabbed up the phone and looked around. Her apartment. Her furniture. Her laptop, doornailed and sprawled on the floor. The now-dry coffee mug.

No Lovelace.

Heleth prowled through the dark apartment, small though it was, peering into all the cat’s hidey-holes. Any kind of shadow would cloak a tortoiseshell cat, as Heleth well knew, but she’d also never known the cat to stay hidden when called. Then she pulled out the big guns: a little cardboard can of kitty treats. She shook it, calling Lovelace’s name, but there was no trill of excitement, no tiny thud thud thud of eager paws.

She slumped to her bed, feeling worse than she had when she’d first awakened in all kinds of achy pain. If this was all a Wizard of Oz (film, not book) dream, then where was her cat? At most, she’d been out a few hours. There were no open windows. The doors were locked. There was nowhere the cat could have gone.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="205" tags="" position="250,1500" size="100,100">config.header.right: passage.name

Not much of a day. 4am Charlie jumped the wall in the yard and let out an unholy riot because he couldn&#39;t get back in and was terrified. Then once I got him back in he had the zoomies for an hour. A big storm came up, and between that and the uterus I felt so awful that I slept till 4pm. Got up, made human soup, had pumpkin soup, watched Falcon &amp; Winter Soldier with Amy &amp; Paul, called the &#39;rents, and it&#39;s bedtime again. Whatever.

A montage of film scenes flickered through her mind. *Big*, when Tom Hanks had tried to go back to Zoltan and get changed little again. *Freaky Friday*, all versions, where mom and daughter tried to recreate the conditions that led to their body swap. Claire in *Outlander* slapping her palms against those massive stones trying to travel magically back through time. It never worked right when you tried to reverse the uh-oh. It never did it when you actually wanted it to. Only when you’d learned your lesson, when your character arc was finished, when your mission was accomplished. Basically, when it worked right for the narrative.

But what arc had she gone through? What lesson had she learned? Fuck all, that was what. She wasn’t a better person today than she had been all those months ago. She didn’t know more about life or about goals or about her relationships. She didn’t have more direction, hadn’t experienced an epiphany, hadn’t changed her status quo. It was all just random fucking bullshit that happened or it didn’t, with no rhyme or reason.

She lay back on the bed, staring at her ceiling, at the pattern in its popcorn texture that she’d long ago sketched out constellations within. Most of them were some variation on cats, or internet memes, or game characters.

“What the fuck do you want from me?” she asked the ceiling. “Why are you doing this to me?”

It was unclear if she was talking to god, or the universe, or the Yoshi face floating in the plaster.

“Is this real? Was that? What was any of it? Am I awake now? Alive? Or was I awake before and this is the dream? Am I dead? Did Lovelace really exist? Why would you do this to me? Why, of all things evil, would you put me through all this and then *take my cat from me*?”

Interesting day today. Started with a meeting about developing a strategic investment area concept for the uni in scicomm, and then the guy who called it threw all his toys out of the pram and said FMC was the tantrum-thrower, so I played dumb and did an end-around him to take it over. Hilarity. Otherwise, same old same old.

She wouldn’t stop asking the questions. They just kept going and going and going.

“Was I really in the Internet all this time? Where is my cat? I had a cat, right? If I fall asleep again, here, where I’m not sure what’s a dream and what’s real, does it create an existentialist black hole that sucks the entire universe in and restarts it with the big bang?”

“Oh for Christ’s sake, stop whining already.”

Heleth launched herself into a sitting position. Despite the movement, she seemed neither surprised nor terrified to see me. It kind of bummed me out. Mostly, when she spotted me lounging in her bedroom doorway, she looked disappointed.

“Why do you look disappointed?” I asked.

“I thought you were Lovelace. You sound like Lovelace. Why do you sound like Lovelace?”

“Oh, man,” I said. “It’s a shitty trope, isn’t it, the writer sticking themselves into the story? I probably wouldn’t have had to do it if I connected with you in any way as a character.”

“Wow.” She leaned back on her headboard, and it rattled against the wall. I hated that about her; why couldn’t she secure her headboard to her bed properly? “You’re really an asshole, aren’t you?”

I shrugged and made my way to the little chair in the corner, shoving her week’s worth of sweatpants off it. “What do you expect? I make up people like you and then torture them for a living. Hell, not even for a living; I never seem to make any money off what I write. Apparently, I torture you just for shits and giggles.”

She contemplated this, her lips pressed flat and white. “Why would anyone want to do that—wait, nevermind.” She held up a hand and shook her head. “I don’t want to know. I just want to know where my cat is.”

Good day today. Some work done, and did my Woman E-Lit talk, which went over well. V. sleepy now tho.

“Right where you left her,” I said. “In between the Interwebs.”

“The ‘Interwebs’, really? No one thinks that’s funny anymore.”

“You better chill. It’s my fingers on this here keyboard.” Yeah, yeah, I know. I’m a bully. What do you want.

“Listen,” Heleth said, and I really hate it when people say “listen” like that. It’s the same tone of voice when they say “calm down” or “you’re being ridiculous”. Sometimes I *am* being ridiculous. But in the history of being ridiculous, no one ever calmed down because you told them to listen in a condescending voice. Or something.

Where were we?

Oh. She said, “Listen. I don’t want to piss you off, obviously.”

“Obvs.”

“But you gotta know you’re fucking me up all kinds of ways.”

“As I told you, that’s my job.”

She threw a pillow at me. I caught it and hugged it, because who isn’t more comfortable when in conflict with a stranger than if they hug a pillow?

“Why can’t you just leave me here and give me back my cat?” she asked me.

I didn’t answer right away. Confession time. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I created Heleth and Lovelace initially as an example. They weren’t a real story; they were just a funny title I could use whenever I needed to mock something up for students. I have a million other creative things I should be working on. Hell, I have a whole book I’m contracted for that I *definitely* should be writing instead of this. But for a really long time I had a really bad time. I called out a misogynistic, sexual predator bully at work, and instead of being Anita Hill I was… well, I was Anita Hill. People believed me, but I was still the one who was punished. I couldn’t work. And then I got another job, and it seemed like a dream job, only the same damn bullying dynamic was at work there, and damned if I didn’t walk right into it *and not put up with it*. So I couldn’t work again, because depression and anxiety are steamrollers that take all your steam. And when your work is utterly and completely driven and reliant on steam (or brain function, in case my metaphor rolled over you), ain’t no way, baby. And then I *finally* got a job with motherfucking WOMEN in charge, and I can’t begin to tell you what a relief and a delight and a dream it has been. And I feel better and I feel bright again and like I can do the things that I made myself into a person to do. So I wanted to get back to that process that gives me joy, the writing, and I said “I can write 300 words a day, that’s doable even with job and pandemic and life and a puppy and a farm.” So I did. I started with this stupid, mock-up title, and a weak-ass concept: what if a tech-nerd cat lady fell into the Internet with her cat? 300 words a day and 200-some-odd days later, I have over 70k words of a story that does exactly jack-shit.

So what the hell do I do with Heleth? And what have I already done with Lovelace?

I dropped my head back on the chair, staring at Heleth’s ceiling. It was wispy with cobwebs. Heleth is about as good a housekeeper as I am.

I wondered why I created Heleth this way. Utter lack of self-awareness. Lack of drive. Lack of social connection. Was I a lazy writer, or is there something in her I want to explore? Maybe Heleth was my midlife crisis. I can’t even existentialate with any aplomb.

You want the truth? The real truth? I don’t even care much. I’m done with Heleth. I want to break up with her. I mean, I’d like to keep Lovelace, but that’s mostly because she’s based on my beloved tortie that I lost far too soon. Heleth, though? Meh. Now that I’ve gotten back in the rhythm of writing, have actually established a daily writing habit for the first time in my *life*, I want to go back to the project I’ve been working on since 2016, the one I think actually has legs. Heleth doesn’t have legs. Heleth is my lazy self who wants to grow into the sofa.

“Heleth,” I said, still staring up at the ceiling. “What do you want?”

She gave a frustrated little scream. “Why does everyone keep asking me that?”

“Because that’s life!” I hollered at her, sitting up. “I want things in life. I want to be a Professor. I want to win awards for the stupid shit I write. I want at least one thing I create to be considered ground-breaking. I want to live on my farm forever and ever with my husband and my dogs and horses and chickens and cats. I want my family to stop being gross bigots. I do stuff to make these things happen. You get it?”

“Oh yes,” she said. “I totally get it. You wanting to be the smartest person in any room totally clears things up for me.”

“You learned that sarcasm from me,” I muttered.

Heleth threw a pillow at me. It was a terrible throw, and I didn’t even bother to flinch. 

“What do *you* want from *me*?” she asked me. “Apparently you put me here. You did this to me. You made me all blank and ambitiousless and entirely arrested. Why?”

I looked blearily at her. “I thought it’d be funny.”

“Sorry, what?”

I sighed. One never thinks one is going to actually have to face the imaginary creatures one tortures, does one? (May that be the one—pun intended—and only time I use the indefinite neutral.) “I thought it’d be funny. The title is funny. The concept is funny. Hell, the cat is funny. But you never progressed. You never developed. I never got hold of you.”

“That sounds like a you problem.”

“And that’s exactly it.” I kicked at the downed pillow. “My main characters are always some part of me. Sometimes a fear, sometimes a wish, sometimes just a bit of a mirror.”

This interested her. She cocked her head at me, staring me up and down. “I’m supposed to be you?”

“Not me, not really. Just some part of me. But I can’t suss you out. You’re Jell-O.”

“I’m supposed to know what that means?”

“Jell-O. No matter what you do to it, it just blobs back into its shape. You can’t push it or pull it or throw it. You smoosh it, and it might smoosh, but it’s still Jell-O. You eat it, though, and it just dissolves. There’s nothing to it, even if it looks super substantial.”

“I’m sugar and water and gelatin.”

“Don’t forget food coloring.”

“Of course not, how could I forget food coloring.” She threw her second pillow at me, and that left her with no pillows. “I’m Jell-O?! What the actual fuck?”

Drama in the Skains family today. Woke up to a message from Dad that he sent at 8am (2am his time) asking me if I was up. I wasn&#39;t, of course. When I finally talked to him, he said Tres had called him at 1:30am, left a message that he was being held hostage by the movers moving his ex-GF out of his apartment, and to please help. Dad called him, and he said the same thing, but not to come, not to call the police, and to give him 5 hours to figure it out. Dad went over there, but the place was dark and quiet, and he couldn&#39;t get an answer when he knocked. Didn&#39;t want to call cops, because obvs reasons, so sat outside and waited (that&#39;s when he tried to message me). Finally went home, didn&#39;t sleep, managed to get Tres this morning, and Tres had no memory of any of it. Slept through the night as far as he knew. Finally cleared up this afternoon - his stupid RN had prescribed Tramadol for the pain in his foot from when he ran over it last month, and it did NOT go down well. He&#39;s already thrown it out, and I gave him my ankle protocol. Dad was pretty upset from being scared to death - he even thought Tres might have harmed or killed himself. Poor Dad. Anyway, that was my day. Fun.

Frustrated, I heaved up the pillows and chucked them back at her. “I don’t know. I don’t know, okay? I made you, I put you in stupid situations, and then I had to figure out how to get you back out again. That’s all I know.”

She pulled her knees in and dropped her forehead on them. A low moan came out of her. “I don’t want to do this anymore,” she said into her body cave.

“Don’t get maudlin.”

“I will if I want. I don’t care who you are or what power you have, I can feel shitty if I want to. I want my cat.”

I snapped my fingers. “Fine! Here’s your dang cat.”

Nothing happened. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I am literally sitting here typing this mother fucking story, and I should very well be able to just write the words “Lovelace appeared and jumped onto the bed with Heleth and Heleth was happy and squeezed her perhaps a little too hard but it was okay and they lived happily ever after and I got to end the story and go write the one I really wanted to.” But whenever I try to do it outside of quotation marks, nothing happens.

“Where is she then?” Heleth asked.

“I don’t… I can’t.” I stared at my fingertips. “I can’t bring her.”

“Then put me back with her. Send me back.”

I couldn’t stop staring at my fingertips.

“Please?” Heleth said. She was looking at me, tears streaming down her face. You know how some people are social vomiters? Somebody voms, and they can’t help but vomit, too? I’m a social crier. I see tears, and here come my own waterworks.

“Stop crying,” I said. “I’m not going to send you back.”

“Why not?” She did not stop crying. In fact, she did it more.

“Jesus Christ,” I said. “You’re making me feel like a monster.”

“You are a fucking monster!”

“Goddammit, all I want is for this story to end.” I wished I had kept the pillows. I needed to throw something. “I brought you back here. I tried to bring the damn cat back, but I *can’t*.”

“You can’t leave me like this.”

“I get it, okay? Just… let me think.” But I knew. I knew what I’d done. I’d gotten bored with her story, lost, not knowing where it was going, not knowing who she was or what I was doing with her. So I forced it. I forced her back into her world, tried to end these shenanigans artificially. I’ve been doing this long enough. I should have known that was never going to work. 

The cat knew. That’s what’s niggling at me now. Heleth came back to the apartment when I pulled her, but the cat didn’t follow. Not even when I tugged really, really hard. Am I writing this story? Or is Lovelace? 

I push the thought away. Back to Heleth.

I sighed. “Fine. I tried. But it seems your stupid story isn’t stupid done.” And I got the hell out of that stupid apartment.

Heleth awoke with a start. Her hip and shoulder and back ached again, throbbing where they met the hard floor. She blinked her world into focus, rolling over onto her back. Nothing interfered with her movement, and her vision filled with familiar cool blue light. The screenportals.

She reached out a hand, and within seconds it encountered a warm ball of fluff that chirped when she touched it. Lovelace.

Heleth rolled back over and vacuumed the cat into a teddy bear hug. She buried her face in the belly fur, risking life and sight to do so. But Lovelace only purred and pushed her nose against Heleth’s jaw.

Just a nice Sunday. Good weather. Groomed the shedding horses a bit. Had a WritePod. The Nigerian e-lit person who wrote gross misogynistic and homophobic stuff barely logged in, and doesn&#39;t seem to get why his work is so gross. But anyway...

“I don’t know what’s real and what’s not anymore, Lovey,” Heleth whispered into the warm, sweet-smelling fur.

“What’s real is that I’m being squished.”

“And?”

“I wasn’t protesting. Just commenting.”

So Heleth squished her cat, who did not protest. After a while, however, they both became uncomfortable, so they parted ways. Mildly, anyway. Heleth wasn’t particularly willing to be more than eighteen inches from her cat.

“I’ve decided something,” Heleth told her as they strolled once more through the maze of screenportals.

“I hope it’s Chinese. I like the shrimp.”

“I was thinking Italian. Craving lasagne. Anyway, that’s not the point.”

“It is the point. Lasagne never has shrimp. And if you make a Garfield joke, I will cut you.”

Heleth closed her mouth. “I’m sure we’ll find something that appeals to you. But food isn’t what I decided about. I decided what we’re going to do.”

They walked on for quite some time, Lovelace pausing occasionally to mew around various Chinese or seafood sites. Heleth finally spotted a promising Italian place, and stopped in front of it.

“You’re really not going to ask me what I decided?” she asked her cat, who had sat on her haunches, pouting at the thought of no shrimp.

“You’ll tell me eventually.”

Heleth shrugged. “I guess.” Nothing followed, so she scooped the cat up, ignoring Lovelace’s screm of protest, and hopped through to the food. Only when an order of shrimp linguine arrived did Lovelace relent and concede to listen to her big decision.

Heleth took four more bites of lasagne before filling the cat in. “I’ve decided we’re staying.”

“What, in this Italian kitchen? Okay.” The tortie crunched through another shrimp, shell and all.

“No. In the Internet.”

“Okay.”

“We’ve done fine here. We’ve got everything we need.”

“Okay.”

“And there’s nothing for us back in the real world. Just bills and shit.”

“Okay.” Crunch, crunch, crunch.

“So that’s it. We’re now Internet denizens, for realsies.” Heleth scooped lasagne into her gullet, satisfied.

“Okay,” Lovelace repeated.

They both swallowed, sat back, and stared at each other. Lovelace licked her chops, then set about licking her paws clean. Heleth made a swipe at her face with a napkin.

“I mean it,” she said. “Internet lives forever.”

Lovelace rolled her eyes. “I said okay.”

Heleth grinned. A band around her ribs had loosened, the band that had so many expectations writ upon it: job, family, society, parties, promotions, kids, anniversaries, birthdays, rent, mortgage, pensions, insurance, hobbies, training, keeping up with TV shows, watching all the Marvel movies. It was a lot, modern life, and now she didn’t have to do any of it, not that she’d been doing much of it to begin with. Now she could go wherever, do whatever, be whomever. Even if that was just boring old do-nothing Heleth.

Plus, in the interwebs, her cat talked. Despite the insults, she definitely couldn’t give that up.

“So,” she said, leaning over her tiramisu, “I was thinking for our next stop we could try—”

“Nope,” Lovelace said.

“—the *Enterprise* again, now that we… Wait, what?”

“Maybe next time.” The cat sniffed at her tiramisu, wrinkling her nose. “We’ve done everything you wanted so far. From now on, we’re equal partners. You choose, I choose.”

“But…”

“No buts. You agree to my deal or you get stuck wherever you go next. You know you need me to find your exit door.”

Heleth sat back, ladyfinger crumbs dotting her chin. “You little brat.”

The tortie rolled back and proceeded to clean her belly. She said nothing.

“Fine. *Fine*. Whatever. You pick next. Where do you want to go?”

Lovelace looked up, still splaying her undercarriage, her eyes sparkling with what could only be called the spirit of Loki. “I’m quite the Crispin Glover fan. I understand he once did an entire film all about my favorite prey.”

“No.” Heleth shook her head. “No way.”

“Indeed. Heleth, my human, we’re on our way to meet *Willard*.”
